Minor Action, 3 Mana (or Reaction, 6 Mana). Lasts 1d4 turns (roll alteration). 3 Skill Points per tier. Gives Kastun one of the bellow effects:
  
  - Green scales (once Kastun learns to use different scale colors he stops being able to use this one. its boring and too simple to be fun)
    - +1 guard.

  - yellow scales (lightning) (tier 2)
    - when enemy attacks you, they roll Will against 8 + 3*Your Alteration. on a success, they're stunned for the round. Stunned characters can only do one minor/major/move action, not all three. They also take !alteration dmg

OBS: different scales symbolise different subspecies of irucus, and have different buffs (and maybe self-debuffs). still have one main non-expensive and one secondary, more powerful, expensive attack.
