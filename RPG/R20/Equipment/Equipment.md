\**STR*: The minimum strength score requirement to wear the armor.

\**Penalty*: The negative modifier that wearing the armor gives to a character attempting a skill check for which armor is a hinderance (e.g.: stealth)

**Finesse**. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice o f your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**Heavy**. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

**Light**. A light w eapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**Loading**. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece o f ammunition from it when you fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

**Thrown**. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the w eapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

**Two-Handed**. This weapon requires two hands to use.

**Range**. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the w eapon’s long range.

**Reach**. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it.

**Versatile**. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the w eapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Mounted**. This weapon is considered Two-Handed unless the user is mounted.
