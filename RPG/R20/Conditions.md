### Burning
Burning targets take damage at the start of their turn and have disadvantage on concentration checks. Any creature can put out a burning creature by spending their action to pat them out (unless the burn effect specifies otherwise). By default, the burn damage is 1d6 per turn.

### Frightened
A frightened has disadvantage on all rolls made against the source of their fright. At the start of there turn, the frightened creature must succeed on a DC 10 Presence save (or the DC of the fear effect -5, whichever is higher), or they spend all their movement running away from the source of their fear. If the fear effect involves a save each turn, the creature makes one save and considers its result for both the effect save and the "run away" save.

### Paralyzed
A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and canâ€™t move or speak. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet o f the creature.

### Charmed
A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
