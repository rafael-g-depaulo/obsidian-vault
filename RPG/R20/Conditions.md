# Conditions

### Prone
Prone target has movement speed halved, -2 defense against melee attacks and +2 against ranged ones. Standing up from prone takes a movement action. A prone target can once per turn attempt to stand up as a free action, if they pass a DC 14 Acrobatics test

### Burning
Burning targets take damage at the start of their turn and have disadvantage on concentration checks. Any creature can put out a burning creature by spending their action to pat them out (unless the burn effect specifies otherwise). By default, the burn damage is 1d6 per turn.

### Frightened
A frightened has disadvantage on all rolls made against the source of their fright. At the start of there turn, the frightened creature must succeed on a DC 10 Presence save (or the DC of the fear effect -5, whichever is higher), or they spend all their movement running away from the source of their fear. If the fear effect involves a save each turn, the creature makes one save and considers its result for both the effect save and the "run away" save.

### Paralyzed
A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

### Charmed
A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.

### Blinded
• A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.

## Light and vision
A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Perception checks that rely on sight.

A heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque
fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the blinded condition

Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly
obscured area.

Darkness creates a heavily obscured area

## Grapple
The target is Grappled, and the grapple’s escape DC equals **8 + your Strength modifier + your Proficiency Bonus**. This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one Size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab the target. Shove. You either push the target 5 feet away or knock the target Prone. This shove is possible only if the target is no more than one Size larger than you.
