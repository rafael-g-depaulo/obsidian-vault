	- [ ] feat gain temp HP when below 50%
	- [ ] buff sharkodile rage buff
	- [ ] add a bunch of feats that increase max hp
	- [ ] more healing when under 50%

- [ ] make class skills scale with proficiency instead of arbitrarily

## IDEAS
- [ ] give "estilo de" to martials for free.
- [ ] flavor feats required at certain levels
	- [ ] martials get more flavor feats (martial combat feats become more powerful by default. mostly passive stuff, not mana consuming)
- [ ] class ideas
	- [ ] bleed-centric martial, with **Bloody Strike.** (while attacking) free (1PM): the enemy rolls resist (CON). if they fail, they gain 2 bleed stacks. At the start of a creature's turn, if they are bleeding they lose 1d4-1 HP for every stack of bleed and lose 1 stack of bleed. prolly remove con save. maybe keep the con save but make it free to use, and can spend 1PM to garantee the bleed sticks
- [ ] **Martial Techniques:** spells, but for martials
