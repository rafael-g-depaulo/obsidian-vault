# Spell Scrolls
Spell Scrolls are consumable items that contain a spell. They can be used either to:
- Cast the spell
- Learn the spell

All spell scrolls have a tier. The tier of a spell scroll is equal to the MP cost of the spell stored inside it (including all spell modifiers).

## Casting a Spell from a Scroll
Any sentient creature may attempt to cast a spell from a scroll.

**Read Spell Scroll.** Action: make an Arcana skill check (DC 5 + tier). On a success the spell is cast, and the scroll is destroyed. On a failure by 5 or more, the scroll is destroyed. On a failure by 10 or more, the stored mana explodes in a 5sqr side square centered on the scroll, dealing 1d6 energy damage times the scroll tier and destroying the scroll.

If the creature reading the spell doesn't already have a spellcasting ability, they have -5 to their check. If the creature knows the language used to write the scroll, they have +2 to the check.

If the spell uses a spellcasting ability the caster can use one they already have. If the caster doesn't have one, they use PRE.

## Learning a Spell from a Scroll
A spellcaster may attempt to learn the spell stored in the scroll, if they have that ability (All Casters have this ability, while Off-casters don't by default). The reader must already be able to learn spells from that circle (a level 1 caster can only learn scrolls that contain spells of first circle or cantrips).

To attempt it the reader must spend 4 hours reading the scroll for each tier. At the end of this study (that can happen over multiple sessions), the reader makes an Arcana (INT) check, with DC 14 + tier. If they succeed, the reader learns that spell, and adds it to their spell list.

## Creating Spell Scrolls
At the start of the crafting attempt, the spellcaster decides on what spell and what modifiers to use. The total MP cost of the spell (that the spellcaster should be able to cast) becomes the intended spell scroll's tier. To craft a spell scroll, the caster must have ready materials (special parchment, magic ink, etc.) equal to 2gp per MP cost of the spell (including all spell modifiers, that the crafter decides during the crafting process). They then spend 2 hours and 1MP per tier transcribing the spell. At the end of the process, they make an Arcana check (DC 10 + tier). If they succeed, the materials are expended and scroll is created. If they fail by 5 or more, the crafting materials are expended.

## Buying Spell Scrolls
In general, Spell Scrolls sold by merchants and other casters cost ~6gp per tier

OBS: maybe make it be different checks instead of all Arcana?
