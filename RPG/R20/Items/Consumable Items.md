Poisons and Healing potions have their own sections.

**Healer’s Kit.** This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Medicine check.

**Acid.** As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 1sqr of you or throw the vial up to 4sqr, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.

**Alchemist’s Fire.** This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 4sqr, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a **DC 10 Dexterity** check to extinguish the flames.
