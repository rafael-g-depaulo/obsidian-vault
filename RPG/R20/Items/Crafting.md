# Crafting

**IDEA:** Maybe steal pathfinder's idea of magic item levels and use it here for ingredient and roll CD.

<!--
basic rules:
- needs 25% of the item's value worth of ingredients
- 50gp worth of item/workweek. (increase to more gp/week at later levels.)
- 1 check per workweek

use tools. costs 500silver for a set of tools (-5 without tools)
-->

CD to craft = 10 + 2 \* Item level 

## Crafting Rolls and time to produce an item
Some items are relatively simple and quick to produce, while others become a huge project spanning multiple months. A character can spend their downtime working to craft one or more items. For that, they spend time and materials, and need to use a specific crafting skill and tools. A set of tools of any craft are worth 500 silver.

### Materials
When crafting an item, a character needs to have prepared materials for it, worth 25% of the items total value. The materials must be proper for the item in question, and some items might have particularly hard to acquire materials.

Depending on how the crafter rolls on the skill checks for the item creation, materials may be saved or wasted.

### Time
Crafting an item might be quick or complex, depending on the item. The expected crafting time equals 1 week of work per 50 gold of the item's worth. This time can be taken while adventuring, (during downtime and/or while resting).

If the item being crafted is worth 50 gold or less, then at the end of the crafting time you roll a skill check with the relevant skill. If the item is worth more than 50 gold, at the end of every week spend working on it you roll a new skill check. That check may improve the item's progress, do nothing, regress it or even completely destroy the partially built item.
### Skill
Below is a list of all crafting-related skills. 

| Skill         | Relevant Attribute | Items crafted using it                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alchemy       | DEX                | Potions, poisons, explosives, oils and other alchemical items. |
| Rune Crafting | SEN                | Standalone runes and imbuing runes into items.                 |
| Scribing      | INT                | Spell Scrolls.                                                 |
| Smithing      | STR                | Armor, weapons and ammunition.                                 |

When rolling a skill check for crafting, a character should use a set of tools specific for that skill (alchemy set, smithing's tools, etc.). If they don't have the kit, they have a -5 to the roll.

When rolling the relevant skill the CD is defined by the item rarity.
#### Crafting roll CD by item rarity
| Item Rarity | CD  |
| ----------- | --- |
| Common      | 10  |
| Uncommon    | 15  |
| Rare        | 18  |
| Very rare   | 20  |


After rolling and comparing against the item CD

| Skill check result | Crafting progress                      | Materials spent  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Passed by 5+       | Item crafting progresses.              | 50% of expected  |
| Passed             | Item crafting progresses.              | 100% of expected |
| Failed             | Item crafting doesn't progress.        | 0                |
| Failed by 5+       | Item crafting doesn't progress.        | 100% of expected |
| Failed by 10+      | Item crafting regresses by 2 workweeks | 100% of expected |

## Crafting Materials (Took mostly from D&D)
An item invariably re quires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the s kin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool o n the Elemental Plane of Water. Finding that material should take place as part of an adventure. The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need access to. 

#### MAGIC ITEM INGREDIENTS
| Item Rarity | CR Range |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Common      | 1-3      |
| Uncommon    | 4-8      | 
| Rare        | 9-12     |
| Very rare   | 13- 18   |
| Legendary   | 19+      |
