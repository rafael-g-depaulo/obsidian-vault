# Crafting

**IDEA:** Maybe steal pathfinder's idea of magic item levels and use it here for ingredient and roll CD.

basic rules:

needs 25% of the item's value worth of ingredients

50gp worth of item/workweek. (increase to more gp/week at later levels.)

1 check per workweek

use tools. costs 500silver for a set of tools (-5 without tools)

## Crafting Rolls and time to produce an item
Some items are relatively simple and quick to produce, while others become a huge project spanning multiple months. A character can spend their downtime working to craft one or more items. For that, they spend time and materials, and need to use a specific crafting skill and tools. A set of tools of any craft are worth 500 silver.

### Time
### Materials
### Skill
Below is a list of all crafting-related skills.

When rolling the relevant skill the CD is defined by the item rarity.

## Crafting Materials (Took mostly from D&D)
An item invariably re quires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the s kin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool o n the Elemental Plane of Water. Finding that material should take place as part of an adventure. The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need access to.

| Very rare   | 13- 18   |
