# Rest & Recovery
An adventuring character recovers HP and MP mainly through resting.

## Provisions
Food, firewood, water... to properly rest, a party needs to expend some provisions. To avoid tracking everything individually, it's recommended to simply have recorded how much money the party has in supplies.

## How to recover
When the party decides to rest, they set up camp for the night.

### Difficulty and Rest CR
The DM chooses the base difficulty for the rest. Chose a base condition level for the situation, with 0 being a favorable and easy condition, and the higher the number, the more harsh the conditions (recommended 0-2 range for inexperienced adventurers, and to never go above 3).

### Expending Provisions
When resting, expending more or less resources has an effect on the quality of the teams' sleep. This reduces the CD for your rest.

| amount spent per person | CD Difference |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| 0                       | -3            |
| 2 silver                | -1            |
| 5 silver                | 0             |
| 20 silver               | +1            |
| 50 silver               | +2            |
| 150 silver              | +3            |

### Skills
A character may attempt to use a skill to improve their rest condition (cooking and survival being the most common ones). The DC is equal to the rest DC.

If they pass the check, all who eat their cooking receive a +2 bonus on this rest. For every 5 above the CD, increase that by +2.

### Result
Do the following calculation to find out the condition of the rest:

Consult the table below to see how the rest affected the characters.

| Level | Condition             | HP Recovery | MP Recovery | Duration | Exhaustion         |
| ----- | --------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| <0    | Bad Condition         | 0           | level/2     | 5 hours  | See below         |
| 0     | Normal Condition      | level/2     | level       | 8 hours  | recovers 1 level  |
| 1     | Good Condition        | level       | level\*2    | 8 hours  | recovers 2 levels |
| 2     | Exceptional Condition | level\*2    | level\*3    | 12 hours | recovers 2 levels |
| -     | Full Reset            | 100%        | 100%        | 1 week   | fully recovers    | 

**Bad Condition Rest.** At the end of the rest you must pass a CON save (DC: Rest DC) or gain 1 level of Exhaustion. Gain +1 level for every 5 below the CD.

#### Descriptions and examples of resting conditions
- **Bad Condition**: Sleeping outdoors without proper equipment and on an empty stomach doesn't give the body, mind and soul the ease and support to properly recover. Takes 5 hours.
- **Normal Condition**: Sleeping outdoors in a sleeping bag and doing a night-watch rotation shift is enough to give a moment of rest and recovery. Takes 8 hours.
- **Good Condition**: Having hearty meal, not taking night watch, sleeping in a cozy tent or next to a warm fire for a long time really makes a difference out there in the wild. Takes 8 hours.
- **Exceptional Condition**: Having a feast, not taking night watch, sleeping in a warm and comfortable condition reinvigorates someone's spirits entirely! Takes 12 hours.
- **Full Reset**: Completely recover's a character's HP & MP, and removes any debilitating conditions except for diseases and curses. Takes 1 week of rest with no adverse conditions (having time off in a Town in between adventures). Recovers fully from exhaustion.

## Skipping a Rest
When skipping a Rest, a character needs to roll a CON or PRE saving throw with DC equal to:
- **15 + 5 \* \# of consecutive days not having slept** 
(1st day: 15, 2nd -> 20, 3rd -> 25,...)

If they fail the character gains 1 level of exhaustion, +1 for every 5 points below the DC. (e.g. a 10 roll against a DC of 20 would give a character +3 exaustion levels)
