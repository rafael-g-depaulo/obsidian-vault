# Rest & Recovery
An adventuring character recovers HP and MP mainly through resting. There are 4 different kinds of resting conditions:

- **Bad Condition**: Recovers half of the character's level worth of MP, and no HP. Sleeping outdoors without proper equipment and on an empty stomach doesn't give the body, mind and soul the ease and support to properly recover. Takes 5 hours. At the end of the rest roll a DC 10 Constitution Check. On a fail, gain 1 level of exhaustion.

- **Normal Condition**: Recovers the character's level worth of MP, and half of their level's worth of HP. Sleeping outdoors in a sleeping bag and doing a nightwatch rotation shift is enough to give a moment of rest and recovery. Takes 8 hours. Recovers 1 level of exhaustion.

- **Good Condition**: Recovers double a character's level worth of MP, and their level's worth of HP. Having hearty meal, not taking night watch, sleeping in a cozy tent or next to a warm fire for a long time really makes a difference out there in the wild. Takes 8 hours. Recovers 2 levels of exhaustion.

- **Exceptional Condition**: Recovers double a character's level worth of MP, and their level's worth of HP. Having a feast, not taking night watch, sleeping in a warm and comfortable condition reinvigorates someone's spirits entirely! Takes 12 hours. Recovers 2 levels of exhaustion.

- **Full Reset**: Completely recover's a character's HP & MP, and removes any debilitating conditions except for diseases and curses. Takes 1 week of rest with no adverse conditions (having time off in a Town in between adventures). Recovers fully from exhaustion.

## Mantimentos (esqueci palavra EN)
Food, firewood, water... to properly rest, a party needs to expend some resources. To avoid tracking everything individually, it's recommended to simply have recorded how much money the party has in supplies.

## How to recover
When the party decides to rest, they set up camp for the night.

### Base Level and Rest CR
The DM chooses the base condition for the rest, which may be Bad, Normal or even worse. Chose a base condition level for the situation. That number can be a negative or positive one, with 1 being normal, and the lesser the number, the worse the condition is.

The DM also chooses secretly the CR of the rest, considering the location, time, weather and other adverse conditions that may apply.

Recommendation for CR: 10 - (2* base level of rest)

### Expending Resources
When resting, expending more or less resources has an effect on the quality of the teams' sleep. This is how the amount of resources spent affects the level of the recovery. 

**Experiment with different prices**
| amount spent per person | bonus |
| ----------------------- | ----- |
| 0g                      | -3    |
| 0.2g (2 silver)         | -1    |
| 0.5g (5 silver)         | 0     |
| 2g                      | +1    |
| 5g                      | +2    |
| 15g                     | +3    |

### Skills
A character may attempt to use a skill to improve their rest condition (cooking and survival being the most common ones). 

The character then rolls a skill check against the Rest CR chosen by the DM. If they pass it, the Rest Level is increased by 1. For every 5 above the CR, the level is increased by another 1 point.

### Result
Do the following calculation to find out the level of the rest:

rest condition level = base level + resource bonus + skill bonus

Consult the table below to see how the rest affected the characters.
