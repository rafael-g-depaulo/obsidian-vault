# Recovery
An adventuring character recovers HP and MP mainly through resting. There are 4 different kinds of resting conditions:

- **Bad Condition**: Recovers half of the character's level worth of MP, and no HP. Sleeping outdoors without propper equipment and on an empty stomach doesn't give the body, mind and soul the ease and support to properly recover. Takes 5 hours. At the end of the rest roll a DC 10 Constitution Check. On a fail, gain 1 level of exhaustion.

- **Normal Condition**: Recovers the character's level worth of MP, and half of their level's worth of HP. Sleeping outdoors in a tent/sleeping bag, with a full belly and doing a nightwatch rotation shift is enough to give a moment of rest and recovery. Takes 8 hours. Recovers 1 level of exhaustion.

- **Exceptional Condition**: Recovers double a character's level worth of MP, and their level's worth of HP. Having a feast, not taking night watch, sleeping in a warm and comfortable condition for a long time reinvigorates someone's spirits entirely! Takes 12 hours. Recovers 2 levels of exhaustion.

- **Full Reset**: Completely recover's a character's HP & MP, and removes any debilitating conditions except for diseases and curses. Takes 1 week of rest with no adverse conditions (having time off in a Town inbetween adventures). Recovers fully from exhaustion.
