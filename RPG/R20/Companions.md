# Companions
This is an optional rule. With this rule, a character can acquire and train a Companion to aid them in their adventures, growing stronger as they do.

To gain a Companion the character must gain one or more **Companion: \_\_\_\_** Feats. (See: Companion Feats). The companion's **Tier** is equal to the ammount of **Companion: \_\_\_\_** Feats the companion's master has for that companion.

During combat, the Companion acts on the same initiative as their master. The Companion has one move action. The Companion's master has the **Command** ability.

**Command.** Movement: your Companion follows a simple order or performs one of their abilities of your choice.

## Stats
The Companion's maximum HP is calculated by:
- **Player\_Level + (Companion\_Tier * Player\_SEN\_MOD)**

The Companion has no MP, and uses their master's MP for their ability that cost MP.

The Companion has Defense equal to:
- **10 + Player\_Proficiency\_Bonus**

When the Companion is acquired, the DM choses 2 attributes. The Companion has proficiency with those saving throws, using their master's proficiency.

The companion has 4sqr speed.

The companion has proficiency with 2 skills of the DM's choice.

Attributes: Distribute 12, 12, 10, 8, 7, 5 between the Companion's attributes. Every Tier after the first gives the Companion an ASI.

Maximum Attributes
| Master Level | Max Attribute Score |
|:------------:|:-------------------:|
|     1-3      |         14          |
|     4-5      |         16          |
|     6-7      |         18          |
|     8-10     |         20          |
|     11+      |         22          |

The companion's size is small. The DM may chose to have the companion grow (by time passing, when their master levels up, when it increases in tier, etc.). The maximum size a companion can have is determined by the table below

| Companion Tier | Companion Maximum Size |
|:--------------:|:----------------------:|
|       1        |         Small          |
|       2        |         Medium         |
|      3-5       |         Large          |
|       6+       |          Huge          |

## Companion death
Companion death rules work the same as PC death rules (can be one-shot, have death saves). If a Companion dies then their master can in their next Full Reset (see: Rest rules) either catch a new Companion with the same stats or lose their **Companion: \_\_\_\_** and gain new Feats of their choice that they have access to.

## Rest
The Companion recovers as much HP as their master does whenever both of them rest.

## Companion Skills
This is a list of all companion skills

**Simple Attack.** The companion attacks an enemy within melee range. This attack counts as a finesse attack (see: finesse weapons). *Pre-requisite: Companion: Attack Initiate*.

The damage dice of the attack depends on the companion's tier:

| Tier | Damage Dice |
|:----:|:-----------:|
|  1   |     1d6     |
|  2   |     1d8     |
|  3   |    1d10     |
|  4+  |    1d12     |

**Special Attack.** The companion attacks an enemy. The attack has either:

|      Range       | Base Cost |
|:----------------:|:---------:|
| Melee 1sqr reach |   -1 PM   |
| Melee 2sqr reach |   0 PM    |
|   Ranged 4sqr    |   1 PM    |
|    Line 6sqr     |   2 PM    |
|    cone 4sqr     |   3 PM    |
|   radius 4sqr    |   3 PM    |

If it's a line, cone or radius then instead of an attack roll it becomes a DEX save with DC = 10 + player proficiency + Companion Tier. On save, the target ignores the damage.

|     Damage Type     | Cost  |
|:-------------------:|:-----:|
|      physical       | +0 PM |
|       poison        | +0 PM |
|        acid         | +1 PM |
| fire, ice, electric | +1 PM |
