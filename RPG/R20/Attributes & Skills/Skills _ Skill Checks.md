## Skill Checks
When a character makes a skill check, they roll against a pre-determined CR set by the DM. Their roll is determined as follows:

- **Skill Check:** 1d20 + Attribute Modifier + Proficiency Bonus

Where "Attribute Modifier" is the modifier to the character's corresponding main attribute of the skill (e.g. when rolling an Insight Skill Check a character with 17 SEN would use +3 as their Attribute Modifier). Proficiency Bonuses are explained below.

In rare circumstances the DM might ask for a different attribute to be used instead of the skill's normal one. Example: Intimidation through a show of force or visual display of apparent strength might use CON or STR as a substitute of PRE, if the DM agrees.

### Skill points
When a character levels up they gain skill points, which they may distribute among their skills. These represent a character's growth, training and experience. A character starts with **5 + their Inteligence Modifier** proficiency points at level 1, and gains **2 + their Inteligence Modifier** (min 2) every levelup after that.

A character's skill bonus for any given skill can only reach up to the maximum defined in the following table.

OBS: most likely this will need to change to 2 every levelup + INT mod every even level up
