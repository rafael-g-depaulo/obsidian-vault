These are primarily responsible in determining a character's physical capabilities.

**Presence**: imposing your will, intimidating, convincing, getting others to understand you, manifesting an "aura", stuff like that

## Determining Base Attribute Scores
### Rolling (discouraged)
I don't recommend this because it has a lot of variance and has a really high average. this system gives characters way more ways to increase their attributes as they level, so a stat rolling system that works well for D&D or T20 isn't really well suited for this. Example: a T20 character is expected to increase their attribute scores by ~6 in 16 levels, a D&D character by about ~6 also, and a character in this system by 8-10.

Buuut... if you really want to do it, I recommend using either a "8, 16 and 4 times 3d6", or a "6 times 3d6, repeat until modifier total is >=6"
