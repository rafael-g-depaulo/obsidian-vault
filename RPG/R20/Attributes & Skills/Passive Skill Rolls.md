## Passive Skill Rolls

A character's passive, neutral ability in a skill means that even when not actively trying, they succeed in all checks of DC smaller than or equal to:

- **8 + ATB + Bonus**, with ATB being their bonus with the relevant attribute, and Bonus being their proficiency in that skill.

Example: Ada, the Rogue, has 17 DEX and 4 points in stealth. Her passive stealth, then, is 8 + 3 + 4 = 15.
