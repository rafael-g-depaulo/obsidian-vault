# Classes
classes are always from one of the archetypes, and add additional abilities that the character earns as they level. they also offer powers that the character may take at each level up after the first.

Below is a list of all classes and a brief description of their abilities.

### Rogue
[[Class - Rogue]]
sneak attack

### Fighter
[[Class - Warrior]]
Extra Attack(2-3). Action surge

### (WIP) Barbarian
### Beast Warrior
[[Class - Beast Warrior]]
Beastly Rage. Savage Attack

### Juggernaut
[[Class - Juggernaut]]
Raise Guard. Powerful Strike.

### Battle Mage
[[Class - Spelgard]]
Spiritual Weapon. Lay on Hands

### Champion
[[Class - Champion]]
Smite! Lay on Hands

### (WIP) Alquimist
[[Class - Alquimist (WIP)]]

### (WIP) Summoner
### (WIP) Rune Crafter

### Monk
big unarmed damage. flurry of blows

### Shapeshifter
shapeshifting. half-caster archetype? or should shapeshifting be it's own archetype? a druid would usually want to cast spells, but a werewolf character or someone who could turn super-sayan wouldn't want to cast spells but *would* want to transform, while still hitting hard. or should that temporary enhancement count differently to shapeshifting?

maybe offcaster? but there are still main casters who would like to shapeshift, right? are there? or does it make sense that druids who chose to wildshape have considerably weaker spells? i think so, but it still leaves us with the super sayan issue. should we allow shapeshifters who don't cast spells at all? i think that might work better as a class from a martial archetype...

**I FUCKING FOUND A SOLUTION BABYYYYYY. LOOK AT THESE BABIES DOWN BELOW**

### Shapeshifter (half-caster)
half caster who can also shapeshift into monsters like D&D druids

### Enhancer (Off-caster)
off-caster who fights and can apply temporary buffs that make them hit harder and stronger. This could also be implemented as a Martial archetype, but i think it would be cooler as an Enhancer.

### Symbiote (Martial)
Can suck off energy from enemies or host (self-damage). uses a lot of MP for abilities (buffs, attacks, utility skills)

### Beast Master (Off-Caster? really complicated)
Can summon and control low CR animals.

### Medium/Summoner
Can spend some time channeling and roll to see what comes out (who's available to be summoned). doesn't actually have long-term summons, it's just usual black magic.

### Bard
Inspiration (flat bonus or dice? AoE or single target?). off-caster
