# Classes
classes are always from one of the archetypes, and add additional abilities that the character earns as they level. they also offer powers that the character may take at each level up after the first.

## List of Classes
Below is a list of all classes and a brief description of their abilities.

### Rogue
[[Class - Rogue]]
sneak attack

### Fighter
[[Class - Warrior]]
Extra Attack(2-3). Action surge

### Beast Warrior
[[Class - Beast Warrior]]
Beastly Rage. Savage Attack

### Juggernaut
[[Class - Juggernaut]]
Raise Guard. Powerful Strike.

### Battle Mage
[[Class - Spelgard]]
Spiritual Weapon. Lay on Hands

### Champion
[[Class - Champion]]
Smite! Lay on Hands

### Enhancer (Off-caster) (WIP)
off-caster who fights and can apply temporary buffs that make them hit harder and stronger. This could also be implemented as a Martial archetype, but i think it would be cooler as an Enhancer.

### Symbiote (Martial) (WIP)
Can suck off energy from enemies or host (self-damage). uses a lot of MP for abilities (buffs, attacks, utility skills)

### Beast Master (Off-Caster? really complicated) (WIP)
Can summon and control low CR animals.

### Medium/Summoner (WIP)
Can spend some time channeling and roll to see what comes out (who's available to be summoned). doesn't actually have long-term summons, it's just usual black magic.

### Bard (WIP)
Inspiration (flat bonus or dice? AoE or single target?). off-caster

## Creating a Class
1. Think of an interesting concept for what your class is and what Theme it plays to, what you want a character of that class to **feel like**, to whoever is playing it (from now referred as the class' **Theme**).
2. Decide if that class needs access to magic or not (and thus if it should be a caster/off-caster or a martial/specialist)
	1. It's common that as you progress with refining the idea and basic design of a class to come back to this step and rethink if you'd like or not for it to use spells (or whatever you reflavor them as) as their main way of interacting with the world as their class.
3. Think of 1 main mechanic (from now referred as the **Core Mechanic**) that character's from that class would use mainly to affect combat. This is the main way to express the **Theme**. Now express that Mechanic as a first level feature.
	1. Example: Beast Warrior's Rage, Rogue's Sneak Attack, Champion's Smite, Plantomancer's Herbology, Werebeast's Bestial Transformation.
4. Figure out what archetype works best with it's **Theme**
5. Think of a level-1 feature (almost always should be a skill that uses MP) to incorporate the main way that class expresses their **Theme**, and interacts with their **Core Mechanic**.
6. Then, if the class isn't from the Caster Archetype: Think of another feature relating to the class' **Theme** (but not necessarily it's **Core Mechanic**), and add that either as a level 2 or 3 class feature.
	1. In specific when designing Caster Classes it may make sense to add the class' **Core Mechanic** at a later level (such as with the Witch class' **Witch's Focus**). In that case this supplementary feature should be made, and added as a first level class feature.
7. Then think of 1 other feature to round out the **Theme** (something that also adds some non-combat flavor/utility). Add them as mid-game class features. {{page-break}}
8. Now think of additional interesting new features and modifications to existing features that play to the class' **Theme**. Observe that while the **Core Mechanic** always has a combat effect, these mechanics don't necessarily have to all have to be obviously useful in combat (though most of them should have some in-combat use). This is a good place to think up of possible variations and specializations within members of the class. Add those as class feats.
	1. **Feat Groups:** In this effort of reinforcing class identity, it's interesting to think of a unique feat template and naming scheme, and apply that to create some different feats for the class, different from the singular feats created previously. Example: Plantomancer's **Herbomancy: \[Blank\]**, Spellgard's **Aura of \[Blank\]** and Beast Warrior's **Wild Rage: \[Blank\]**. It's recommended to have between 1 and 2 Feat groups per class.

### Recommended levels to add class features by archetype
| Archetype  | Core Feature | Auxiliary Feature | Mid-Game Feature |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Martial    | 1st          | 2nd               | 7th              |
| Specialist | 1st          | 3rd               | 7th              |
| Off-Caster | 1st          | 2nd               | 6th/8th          |
| Caster     | 1st          | -                 | 6th/8th          | 

Important tips:
- Class features should always scale with levels, usually as an optional additional MP cost to improve it's effect.
- Most class features should be active skills that cost MP to use (or rarely some other resource). Passive effects and skills that have no cost should exist as the exception, not the rule.
- Feats not from a feat group, on the other hand, usually aren't skills in and of themselves, but instead modify other class features or add in some passive effect or alternative way of using existing skills (possibly costing additional MP).
