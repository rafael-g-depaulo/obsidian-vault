**Hex**. Hexes are concentration spell-like abilities. At level 1 you learn one Hex from the Witch's Hex List, and learn a new one every 4 levels.  

**Witch's Focus.** With your experience (and particular focus) in long term curses and boons, you can focus on many ongoing magical effects at once. You can concentrate on 2 effects at once instead of 1. This increases by 1 when you reach 6th, 10th and 14th level, respectively. (OBS: *you still need to pay 1PM/turn for each effect you're concentrating on*).

TODO: add witches brews (out of combat potions with healing and random effects. good way to spend more PM)
Witches Brew: combination of effects (decide some, roll for most). all effects have a positive and a negative.

ex:
- bonus on skill checks & take damage
- heal + disadvantage on initiative
- mana + no extra crit damage (too weak? prolly change)


### Witch Feats
Begining at level 2, every time you gain a level in Witch you gain a Witch Feat. You may instead of a Witch feat take a Caster or General Feat of your choice.

- *Focused Cantrip*. Your damaging cantrips do an extra die of damage per effect you're concentrating on.

- *Scary Look.* (2PM) Action: A creature you can see rolls a Presence saving throw against your Spell DC. If they fail, they are frightened of you until the end of the scene (See: *Condition: frightened*). At 123th, 123th and 123th level you can spend +2PM to increase the DC by 2.

- *NAME HERE.* Scary Look is now AoE.

- *NAME HERE.* Scary Look now makes target scared of all your allies. 13th level minimum.

- *Cantrip asdaf.* Your cantrips have +1 to their DC, and +1 for every effect you're concentrating on.

- *NAME HERE.* Advantage on CON saves to keep concentration if the save was triggered by someone affected by your Hex.

- *NAME HERE.* +x to double range of Hex.

- *NAME HERE.* +x target an aditional creature when you cast a Hex. 8th level witch.

- *NAME HERE.* learn 2 hexes.

- *NAME HERE*. Be able to change what attribute the target uses for a save


TODO: give all the hexes some cool, gross descriptions and names. like they should make the target weird, slimy, neurotic and shit. really up the flavor of it

### Hex List:
A witch's Hex is an inescapable effect. While you concentrate on it, the target cannot get rid of the hex.
 
By default, a Hex takes a movement action to cast, has a range of 9sqr, costs 0PM and targets one creature you can see. You can change the target of your Hex for free if the original dies.
 
Most Hexes also gain an additional effect for each other effect you're concentrating on.

- *Hex: Frail.* The target has -1 Defense, and -1 for each other effect you're concentrating on.

- *Hex: Drain.* Your first ally each turn that hits the target recovers (your Presence mod.) HP, +1 for each other effect you're concentrating on.

- *Hex: Weakened.* The target has -1 to all of their saving throws, -1 for each other effect you're concentrating on.

- *Hex: Slowed.* The target has their movement speed halved.

- *Hex: Fragile.* Your first ally each turn that hits the target deals an extra 1d6 damage, +1d6 for each other effect you're concentrating on.

Spell List:

Some mix of druid-like and warlock-like spells, focusing on debuffs, some few buffs, healing, and a lot of concentration stuff. Also a lot of save spells, and not many attack spells.
