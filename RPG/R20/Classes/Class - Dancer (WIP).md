main mechanic:
- do XXXXX to gain "steps"
	- steps can be spent to move better
	- steps can be spent on special moves
	- steps can be spent to use skills that use Movement Actions as a Free Action
	- steps can make attaks better and/or many attacks

Ideas:
- roll performance to get buffs
- no damage on dex saves, half on fail.

- "step" skills
	- dont provoke opportunity attacks with movement
	- move through people
	- walk forward a bunch and hit hard
	- dance through enemies and damage them
	- increase AC temporarily
	- gain adv on resist rolls??? prolly not
