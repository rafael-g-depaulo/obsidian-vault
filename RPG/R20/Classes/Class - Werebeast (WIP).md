**Wild Dice (2).** Most of your abilities as a Werebeast are based off of your Wild Dice, which is a d8. You start of with 2 Wild Dice, and gain another at 5th, 9th and 14th levels.

**Beast Form. Full Action (2PM):** You go through a violent transformation, becoming a wild, untamed beast. You gain 1d8+your Werebeast level temporary hit points. You can spend +1 PM, up to your Wild Dice, to increase that by 2d8. You also lose all weapon/armor proficiencies and ignore all bonuses from armor you were wearing until you leave your **Beast Form**.

While on best form you gain a natural weapon of your **Wild Dice** slashing damage (crit 20/2x).

While on your beast form, you switch your physical and mental attributes. Strength <-> Inteligence, Dexterity <-> Sensibility, Constitution <-> Presence.

If you lose your temporary hit points, you revert back to your human form. You can also voluntarily turn back as a Movement Action.

**Monstruous Blood. Action (1PM+, up to your Wild Dice):** 
- Human form: Choose an ally you can see within 6sqr of you. They recover 1d8 HP per PM spent.
- Beast form: Make a ranged attack (DEX) against an enemy you can see within 6sqr of you. On a hit they take 2d8 poison damage, +1d8 per PM spent after the first.
