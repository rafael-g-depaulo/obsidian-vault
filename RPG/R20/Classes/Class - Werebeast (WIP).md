**Beast Form. Action (2PM):** You go through a violent transformation, becoming a wild, untamed beast. You gain 1d8+your Werebeast level temporary hit points, and gain a natural weapon of 1d8 (20/2x) slashing damage.

While on your beast form, you switch your physical and mental attributes. Strength <-> Inteligence, Dexterity <-> Sensibility, Constitution <-> Presence.

If you lose your temporary hit points, you revert back to your human form. You can also voluntarily turn back as a Movement Action.

At 5th, 9th and 15th levels your natural weapon damage increases by 1d8, and you can spend an extra 2PM when transforming to increase your temp HP by 2d8

**Monstruous Blood. Action (1PM):** 
- Human form: Choose an ally you can see within 6sqr of you. They recover 1d8 HP
- Beast form: Make a ranged attack (DEX) against an enemy you can see within 6sqr of you. On a hit they take 2d8 poison damage. This damage increases with your natural weapon damage
