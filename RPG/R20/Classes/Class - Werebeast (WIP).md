**Beast Form. Action (2PM):** You go through a violent transformation, becoming a wild, untamed beast. You gain 1d8+your Werebeast level temporary hit points, and gain a natural weapon of 1d8 slashing damage.

While on your beast form, you switch your physical and mental attributes. Strength <-> Inteligence, Dexterity <-> Sensibility, Constitution <-> Presence.

If you lose your temporary hit points, you revert back to your human form. You can also voluntarily turn back as a Movement Action.

At X levels, your natural weapon damage increases by 1d8, and you can spend an extra 2PM when transforming to increase your temp HP by 2d8

**Monstruous Blood. Action (1PM):** 
- Human form: Choose an ally you can see within 6sqr of you. They recover 1d8 HP
- Beast form: Make a ranged attack (DEX) against an enemy you can see within 6sqr of you. On a hit they take 2d8 poison damage.
