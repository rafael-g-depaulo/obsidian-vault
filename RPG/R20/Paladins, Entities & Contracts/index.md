# Contracts, Paladins & Entities

Warlocks. Paladins. Clerics. Priests. That one fool who made a deal with the devil. The bard with the Dragon sugar daddy. What do they all have in common? They all have a contract with a powerful being, an "Entity".

## Paladins

In R20 any character that, willingly or not, finds themselves in a contract with a powerful being is called a "Paladin". That being is, until the contract is broken (an extremely rare occurrence), that Paladin's Entity.

## Contract
The contract, also known as their Oath, is what defines the relationship between a Paladin and their Entity, and grants them access to their Entity's miracles. The contract is rarely an explicitly defined thing, and even less commonly an actual, physical item.

While not all contracts are alike, nearly all of them follow a common pattern, with things a Paladin can do to earn Favor, and things that would make them lose Favor.

## Favor
Favor is the concept of how much an Entity cares for and is willing to help their Paladin. In gameplay terms, that is represented by Favor Points, or FP. At the moment that the contract is made, the Paladin starts with 0 FP. They gain FP by a variety of ways, and spend FP to gain their Entity's help and perform Miracles. A Paladin's maximum FP is equal to 5 times their level.

The following are the usual ways in which a Paladin earns the Favor of their entity, according to their contract.

### "The Mana Tax"
Every time a Paladin expends energy, they unconsciously send a portion of that energy to their Entity through the link their contract gives them. Mecanically, they have higher MP costs for all of their spells and abilities. The Paladin gains 1FP for every MP used towards "The Mana Tax".

A common rule for the "Mana Tax", as it's commonly refered to, is "+1 to the first skill used every turn that costs MP".

Other alternatives:
- "the maximum between 1 and half of the skill's cost, rounded down" (e.g.: 1 -> +1, 2 -> +1, 3 -> +1, 4 -> +2, 5 -> +2, 6 -> +3, etc.). 
- "+1 to all abilities and +X to all spells, where X is the spell's circle".

"The Mana Tax" doesn't count towards the maximum MP a character may use for a skill.

### Working towards their Mission
Though not common, some Paladins are given a specific mission by their Entity. Working towards that goal may earn them Favor with their Entity.

### Upholding the Entity's values
Doing something their Entity likes. Working towards their Entity's goals (if they have any), or helping them in general, is an obvious and very effective way of gaining their Favor, and improving the relationship between them and their Paladin.

## Losing Favor
Just as upholding their Entity's values and working towards their mission can help a Paladin earn their Favor, going against their values, helping their enemies or simply getting on their Entity's bad side can cause a Paladin to lose Favor (FP) with their Entity.

## Miracles
Every entity has a set of miracles their Paladins can perform with their help. All miracles work like active abilities a Paladin may use by spending their Entity's energy (and usually also their own). Mechanically, this means that performing Miracles always spends FP, and sometimes also MP/HP (the MP cost of a Miracle is exempt from the Mana Tax).

### Learning Miracles
By default, a Paladin knows up to 1 + half their level (rounded down) of their Entity's Miracles for which they have the pre-requisites, and they can perform them.

### Using Miracles
By default, you can spend up to 2 + your level FP on a single miracle. If it costs more than that, you cannot perform it.

### Spells as Miracles
Most miracles mechanically function as spells. When adding a spell as one of the miracles a god grants access to, it's recommended to make it's cost **(1 + orignal MP cost) FP**. So a cantrip would cost 1FP, a 1st level spell 2FP, a 6th level spell 9FP, etc.

### Miracle casting attribute
Many miracles involve a character's "miracle casting attribute". That attribute is determined when the contract is formed, and is usually either Presence or Sensibility.

### Miracle DC
The DC to resist your miracles is equal to **8 + proficiency bonus + Miracle casting attribute mod.**

## Blessings
Entities also have blessings, which are Feats that only their paladins have access to. A Paladin may on level up choose to gain a Blessing instead of one of their classe's feats.
