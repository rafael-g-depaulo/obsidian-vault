### General Abilities

**Endurance:** movement (2MP): for the rest of the scene, all damage you take that's equal or below your guard becomes 0.

**Uncanny Dodge:** when taking damage, reaction (3PM): halve the incoming damage. You can't spend more PM using Uncanny Dodge in a scene than you have Dodge.

**Criar Muda.** As a movement or main action on your turn, you may spend 1PM and a Magic Seed to summon a sappling to an unnocupied space withing short distance of you. You can cast spells through the sappling, and percieve its surroundings as if you were standing there. (This counts as a Herbomancy power)

**Semente Mágica (2/dia).** You grow and maintain a small garden of magical plants. That garden provides you at the start of the day with a number of seeds filled with magical potential (they rot away if not used by the end of the day).

- **Kit de primeiros socorros (0/10 usos).** This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Medicine check.

- 2x **Potion of Healing.** A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.
