## Crafting Materials

An item invariably re quires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the s kin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool o n the Elemental Plane of Water. Finding that material should take place as part of an adventure. The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need access to.
