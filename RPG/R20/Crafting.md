# Crafting

**IDEA:** Maybe steal pathfinder's idea of magic item levels and use it here for ingredient and roll CD.

basic rules:

needs 25% of the item's worth of ingredients

50gp worth of item/workweek. (increase to more gp/week at later levels.)

1 check per workweek

use tools. costs 500silver (-5 without tools)

## Crafting Roll
1 roll per workweek. if it takes multiple weeks you can roll again, but after 3 fails the item breaks and all materials are lost. fails can maybe add other adversities (build fail table).

The CD is defined by the item rarity.

#### Crafting roll CD by item rarity
| Item Rarity | CD  |
| ----------- | --- |
| Common      | 10  |
| Uncommon    | 15  |
| Rare        | 18  |
| Very rare   | 20  |
| Legendary   | 25  | 

## Crafting Materials (Took mostly from D&D)
An item invariably re quires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the s kin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool o n the Elemental Plane of Water. Finding that material should take place as part of an adventure. The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need access to. 

#### MAGIC ITEM INGREDIENTS
| Item Rarity | CR Range |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Common      | 1-3      |
| Uncommon    | 4-8      | 
| Rare        | 9-12     |
| Very rare   | 13- 18   |
| Legendary   | 19+      |
