# Spell Tags

## Tags

OBS: nothing stops spells from overlapping groups (e.g.: a spell can be wild, negative and arcane at once).
OBS2: it's possible for a spell to belong to a group without belonging to one of it's sub-tags. ex: Mage hand isn't ilusion, divination or enchantment, but it's trickery

### Considering:
- maybe separate curse into 2 different tags if the need arises (considering... sounds like maybe a good idea)
- remove physical tags. hasn't been an example yet of it being useful
- maybe add a tag specifically for self combat buffs?
- maybe remove summon from wild group. only do it after a concrete example shows up
- maybe split up boost? like body modifying stuff and added energy/extra stuff
