# Spell Tags

asdasdasd

TODO: code JS script to read all spells and check if tags respect hierarchy (e.g. all plant spells should also be wild spells). it should only give warnings

## Tags

list of tags:
OBS: nothing stops spells from overlapping groups (e.g.: a spell can be wild, negative and arcane at once).
OBS2: it's possible for a spell to belong to a group without belonging to one of it's sub-tags. ex: Mage hand isn't ilusion, divination or enchantment, but it's trickery

### Considering:

- maybe remove summon from wild group. only do it after a concrete example shows up
- maybe separate curse into 2 different tags if the need arises
