# Spell Tags

## Tags

list of tags:
OBS: nothing stops spells from overlapping groups (e.g.: a spell can be wild, negative and arcane at once).
OBS2: it's possible for a spell to belong to a group without belonging to one of it's sub-tags. ex: Mage hand isn't ilusion, divination or enchantment, but it's trickery

### Considering:

- maybe separate curse into 2 different tags if the need arises (considering... sounds like maybe a good idea)
- remove physical tags. hasn't been an example yet of it being useful
- maybe add a tag specifically for self combat buffs?
- maybe remove summon from wild group. only do it after a concrete example shows up

### Tag descriptions

1. arcane: (general magic stuff. grease, prestidigitation, tiny hut and shit)

- #occult
  - #curse (debuf)

  - #divination (also all communication stuff)
  - #enchantment
  - maybe add a "sound/word/speech" thing here? a lot of them i've been just grouping into wind but idk... it would also give me a good excuse to bump divination to arcane. then warmagic could maybe go to thaumaturgy? then chronomancy would prolly vanish
