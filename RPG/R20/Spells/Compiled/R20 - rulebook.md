# Attributes

## Description
### Physical Attributes
These are primarily responsible in determining a character's physical capabilities.

**Strength**: direct physical power and athelitic prowess.

**Dexterity**: agility.

**Constituition**: endurance.

### Mental Attributes

**Intelligence**: reasoning. memory.

**Sensibility**: perceiving, receiving and understanding. empathy, perception, getting a gut feeling, attuning to a magic item, reading an "aura", stuff like that.

**Presence**: imposing your will, intimidating, convincing, getting others to understand you, manifesting an "aura", stuff like that.

## Determining Base Attribute Scores
### Rolling (discouraged)
I don't recommend this because it has a lot of variance and has a really high average. this system gives characters way more ways to increase their attributes as they level, so a stat rolling system that works well for D&D or T20 isn't really well suited for this. Example: a T20 character is expected to increase their attribute scores by ~6 in 16 levels, a D&D character by about ~6 also, and a character in this system by 8-10.

Buuut... if you really want to do it, I recommend using either a "8, 16 and 4 times 3d6", or a "6 times 3d6, repeat until modifier total is >=3"

### Score buy
You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost is shown in the table below.

##### Score buy
| Score | Cost |
|:-----:|:-----|
| 8     | 0    |

## Modifiers

##### Attribute score modifiers
| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
|:-----:|:---------|:-----:|:---------|
| 1     | -5       | 16-17 | +3       |
| 2-3   | -4       | 18-19 | +4       |

## Effects
Besides skill checks, attacks, ability and spell DCs and other class features, most Attributes also have other effects for your character.

**Strength**: Your movement speed is increased by 5ft (1 square) times your strength modifier.

**Dexterity**: Your Dodge is increased by your dexterity modifier (see: Attack rolls, Defense and save DCs).

**Constituition**: Your maximum HP gain each time you level up is X + your constituition modifier, where X is determined by your class' archetype (see: Archetypes). Your Guard is increased by your constituition modifier  (see: Attack rolls, Defense and save DCs).

**Intelligence**: You know a number of aditional languages equal to your intelligence modifier. You gain extra skill proficiency points every level up equal to your intelligence modifier.

**Sensibility**: *nothing yet*

**Presence**: *nothing yet*

## Skill Checks
When a character makes a skill check, they roll against a pre-determined CR set by the DM. Their roll is determined as follows:

- **Skill Check:** 1d20 + Attribute Modifier + Skill Bonus

Where "Attribute Modifier" is the modifier to the character's corresponding main attribute of the skill (e.g. when rolling an Insight Skill Check a character with 17 SEN would use +3 as their Attribute Modifier). Skill Bonuses are explained below.

In rare circumstances the DM might ask for a different attribute to be used instead of the skill's normal one. Example: Intimidation through a show of force or visual display of apparent strength might use CON or STR as a substitute of PRE, if the DM agrees.

### Using a different attribute for a skill check

### Using a different skill for a skill check
Many situations allow for different ways for a character to achieve their goals, even if there is a "more common" or "easier" one. A character might want to melt away a locked mechanism with their Alchemist's tools instead of lockpicking it. Another might want to perform crazy stunts and roll acrobatics instead of performance to try to convince The Great Master Artist Cain Delarrouseâ„¢ that he should accept them as an apprentice dancer. A third one could try to roll intimidation instead of persuasion to let the guards in the post let them through, convincing them that it's not worth the trouble to get their asses beat for a random traveler just minding their business.

It's recommended that the DM encourage the player's creativity and ingenuity, and allow them to substitute a skill check (but not a saving throw!) for another one. The DM themselves can suggest it, but it's recommended to leave that to the player's initiative, instead of just presenting them with the option. When using a different skill than the original one for a check, the DM choses how much more difficult the task or objective is with the new approach. Then consult the table below for adjusting the DC of the check for that character.

##### DC for using a different skill for a task
| Aditional Dificulty            | DC  |
| ------------------------------ | --- |
| about the same or a bit harder | +2  | 
| considerably harder            | +5  |

Whether the character is allowed to roll a different skill is always at the DM's discretion.

### Skill Bonus & Skill Points
When a character levels up they gain skill points, which they may distribute among their skills. These represent a character's growth, training and experience. A character starts with **5 + their Inteligence Modifier** skill points at level 1, and gains **2 + their Inteligence Modifier** (min 2) every levelup after that.

A character's skill bonus for any given skill can only reach up to the maximum defined in the following table.

OBS: most likely this will need to change to 2 every levelup + INT mod every even level up

##### Maximum Skill Bonus per level
| Level | Max Skill Bonus |
|:-----:|:--------------- |
|   1   | +2              |
|   2   | +3              |
|   3   | +3              |
|   4   | +4              |
|   5   | +5              | 
|   6   | +5              |
|   7   | +7              |
|   8   | +7              |
|   9   | +7              |
|  10   | +9              |
|  11   | +9              |
|  12   | +9              |
|  13   | +12             |
|  14   | +12             |
|  15   | +12             |
|  16   | +15             |
|  17   | +15             |
|  18   | +15             |
|  19   | +15             |
|  20   | +15             |


# Passive Skill Rolls

A character's passive, neutral ability in a skill means that even when not actively trying, they succeed in all checks of DC smaller than or equal to:

- **8 + ATB + Bonus**, with ATB being their bonus with the relevant attribute, and Bonus being their proficiency in that skill.

Example: Ada, the Rogue, has 17 DEX and 4 points in stealth. Her passive stealth, then, is 8 + 3 + 4 = 15.
