# Attributes

## Description
### Physical Attributes
These are primarily responsible in determining a character's physical capabilities.

**Strength**: direct physical power and athelitic prowess.

**Dexterity**: agility.

**Constituition**: endurance.

### Mental Attributes

**Intelligence**: reasoning. memory.

**Sensibility**: perceiving, receiving and understanding. empathy, perception, getting a gut feeling, attuning to a magic item, reading an "aura", stuff like that.

**Presence**: imposing your will, intimidating, convincing, getting others to understand you, manifesting an "aura", stuff like that.

## Determining Base Attribute Scores
### Rolling (discouraged)
I don't recommend this because it has a lot of variance and has a really high average. this system gives characters way more ways to increase their attributes as they level, so a stat rolling system that works well for D&D or T20 isn't really well suited for this. Example: a T20 character is expected to increase their attribute scores by ~6 in 16 levels, a D&D character by about ~6 also, and a character in this system by 8-10.

Buuut... if you really want to do it, I recommend using either a "8, 16 and 4 times 3d6", or a "6 times 3d6, repeat until modifier total is >=3"

### Score buy
You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost is shown in the table below.

##### Score buy
| Score | Cost |
|:-----:|:-----|
| 8     | 0    |
| 9     | 1    |
| 10    | 2    |
| 11    | 3    |
| 12    | 4    |
| 13    | 5    |
| 14    | 7    |
| 15    | 9    |

### Standard array
15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8

## Modifiers

##### Attribute score modifiers
| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
|:-----:|:---------|:-----:|:---------|
| 1     | -5       | 16-17 | +3       |
| 2-3   | -4       | 18-19 | +4       |
| 4-5   | -3       | 20-21 | +5       |

| 14-15 | +2       | 30+   | +10      |

## Effects
Besides skill checks, attacks, ability and spell DCs and other class features, most Attributes also have other effects for your character.

**Strength**: Your movement speed is increased by 5ft (1 square) times your strength modifier.

**Dexterity**: Your Dodge is increased by your dexterity modifier (see: Attack rolls, Defense and save DCs).

**Constituition**: Your maximum HP gain each time you level up is X + your constituition modifier, where X is determined by your class' archetype (see: Archetypes). Your Guard is increased by your constituition modifier  (see: Attack rolls, Defense and save DCs).

**Intelligence**: You know a number of aditional languages equal to your intelligence modifier. You gain extra skill proficiency points every level up equal to your intelligence modifier.

**Sensibility**: *nothing yet*

**Presence**: *nothing yet*

## Skill Checks
When a character makes a skill check, they roll against a pre-determined CR set by the DM. Their roll is determined as follows:

- **Skill Check:** 1d20 + Attribute Modifier + Skill Bonus

Where "Attribute Modifier" is the modifier to the character's corresponding main attribute of the skill (e.g. when rolling an Insight Skill Check a character with 17 SEN would use +3 as their Attribute Modifier). Skill Bonuses are explained below.

In rare circumstances the DM might ask for a different attribute to be used instead of the skill's normal one. Example: Intimidation through a show of force or visual display of apparent strength might use CON or STR as a substitute of PRE, if the DM agrees.

### Using a different attribute for a skill check

### Using a different skill for a skill check
Many situations allow for different ways for a character to achieve their goals, even if there is a "more common" or "easier" one. A character might want to melt away a locked mechanism with their Alchemist's tools instead of lockpicking it. Another might want to perform crazy stunts and roll acrobatics instead of performance to try to convince The Great Master Artist Cain Delarrouseâ„¢ that he should accept them as an apprentice dancer. A third one could try to roll intimidation instead of persuasion to let the guards in the post let them through, convincing them that it's not worth the trouble to get their asses beat for a random traveler just minding their business.

It's recommended that the DM encourage the player's creativity and ingenuity, and allow them to substitute a skill check (but not a saving throw!) for another one. The DM themselves can suggest it, but it's recommended to leave that to the player's initiative, instead of just presenting them with the option. When using a different skill than the original one for a check, the DM choses how much more difficult the task or objective is with the new approach. Then consult the table below for adjusting the DC of the check for that character.

##### DC for using a different skill for a task
| Aditional Dificulty            | DC  |
| ------------------------------ | --- |
| about the same or a bit harder | +2  | 
| considerably harder            | +5  |

Whether the character is allowed to roll a different skill is always at the DM's discretion.

### Skill Bonus & Skill Points
When a character levels up they gain skill points, which they may distribute among their skills. These represent a character's growth, training and experience. A character starts with **5 + their Inteligence Modifier** skill points at level 1, and gains **2 + their Inteligence Modifier** (min 2) every levelup after that.

A character's skill bonus for any given skill can only reach up to the maximum defined in the following table.

OBS: most likely this will need to change to 2 every levelup + INT mod every even level up

##### Maximum Skill Bonus per level
| Level | Max Skill Bonus |
|:-----:|:--------------- |
|   1   | +2              |
|   2   | +3              |
|   3   | +3              |
|   4   | +4              |
|   5   | +5              | 
|   6   | +5              |
|   7   | +7              |
|   8   | +7              |
|   9   | +7              |
|  10   | +9              |
|  11   | +9              |
|  12   | +9              |
|  13   | +12             |
|  14   | +12             |
|  15   | +12             |
|  16   | +15             |
|  17   | +15             |
|  18   | +15             |
|  19   | +15             |
|  20   | +15             |


# Passive Skill Rolls

A character's passive, neutral ability in a skill means that even when not actively trying, they succeed in all checks of DC smaller than or equal to:

- **8 + ATB + Bonus**, with ATB being their bonus with the relevant attribute, and Bonus being their proficiency in that skill.

Example: Ada, the Rogue, has 17 DEX and 4 points in stealth. Her passive stealth, then, is 8 + 3 + 4 = 15.



# Archetypes
All player characters have a class they belong to. That class, whichever it may be, is associated with an archetype. A class' archetype determines what weapons they have access to, their maximum HP and MP, their spellcasting capability (if any), among other things. A complete list of the archetypes and their characteristics can be seen below.

## Caster
A Caster's main strength is variety, versatility and the raw power of their spells.

### Hit Points (HP) & Mana Points (MP)
A Caster's maximum HP and MP are calculated as such:
- **HP at 1st Level:** 8 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP at 1st Level:** 6 + their spellcasting attribute modifier
- **HP gain per level after 1st:** 2 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP gain per level after 1st:** 6

### Attribute Score Increase
- **Gains ASI at levels:** 4, 8, 12, 16, 19. (5 Total)

### Feats
A Caster has access to all Caster Feats.

### Spells
- **Prepared Spells**: After every rest, a Caster choses up to half (rounded up) of their spells. Those are considered prepared, and they may only cast those spells until their next rest. If a Caster tries to cast a spell they know but have not memorized, they must pass an Arcana Check (DC 20 + the spell's MP cost). On a fail, they spend the MP and the casting time, but the skill fails.
- **Cantrips**: Casters can learn cantrips (0 MP cost spells)
- **Known Spells**: A Caster knows 3 spells at lv1, and learns a new spell every level after that. Whenever they learn a new spell, the spell's circle can't exceed the value in the table below:

##### Caster maximum spell circle per Level
| Level | Spell's Circle |
|:-----:|:--------------:|
|  1-2  |       1        |
|  3-4  |       2        |
|  5-6  |       3        |
|  7-8  |       4        |
| 9-10  |       5        |
| 11-12 |       6        |
| 13-14 |       7        |
| 15-16 |       8        | 
| 17-20 |       9        |


## Off-Caster
An Off-Caster is a mixed-art fighter that dominates the battlefield. Their mix of physical attacks and versatile skills are sure to give them a considerable edge over most opponents.

### Hit Points (HP) & Mana Points (MP)
A Half-Caster's maximum HP and MP are calculated as such:
- **HP at 1st Level:** 14 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP at 1st Level:** 4 + their spellcasting attribute modifier
- **HP gain per level after 1st:** 3 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP gain per level after 1st:** 4

### Attribute Score Increase
- **Gains ASI at levels:** 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17. (6 Total)

### Feats
An off-caster has access to all Caster Feats and all Matial Featst.

### Attacks
- **Simple Weapon Proficiency**: An Off-Caster character has proficiency with Simple Weapons
- **Attack of Oportunity:** An Off-Caster Character tha reaches level 5 is able to perform [[Combat Actions#Attack of Opportunity]].
- **Extra Attack**: An Off-Caster Character that reaches level 7 can attack 2 times on their turn when they use the attack action.

### Spells
- **Innate Knowledge**: An Off-Caster always has all of their spells prepared at all times.
- **No Cantrips**: An Off-Caster can't learn cantrips (0 MP cost spells)
- **Known Spells**: An Off-Caster starts with 1 known spell, and learns a new spell every at every even level. Whenever they learn a new spell, the spell's circle can't exceed the value in the table below:

##### Off Caster maximum spell circle per Level
| Level | Spell's Circle |
|:-----:|:--------------:|
|  1-4  |       1        |
|  5-7  |       2        |
| 8-10  |       3        |
| 11-12 |       4        |
| 13-14 |       5        |
| 15-16 |       6        |
| 17-20 |       7        |

## Specialist
Specialists are exactly what the name implies, incredibly specialized combatants that, instead of focusing on complete mastery of the arcane, martial combat or even a balance of both, have a single niche proficiency or knowledge they use to dominate the battlefield in their own way. Rogues, Artificers, Gunslingers, Alchemists, all of these are primary examples of how a Specialist Class works.

### Hit Points (HP) & Mana Points (MP)
A Specialist's maximum HP and MP are calculated as such:
- **HP at 1st Level:** 10 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP at 1st Level:** 5
- **HP gain per level after 1st:** 3 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP gain per level after 1st:** 5

### Attribute Score Increase
- Specialist **Gains ASI at levels:** 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19. (8 Total)

### Feats
A specialist has access to all Specialist Feats.

### Expertise
Starting at 2nd level, a Specialist gains the **Expertise** feature.

**Expertise.** Choose a number of skills equal to you inteligence modifier (min 1). Before performing a non-attack roll with one of those skills, you may spend 1PM to add your inteligence modifier to the roll. At levels 6, 10, 14 and 18 you chose another skill, and can spend +1PM, and the total added to the roll equals the MP cost times your inteligence modifier.

### Attacks
- **Simple Weapon Proficiency**: Any Specialist character has proficiency with Simple Weapons

### Spells
None by default


## Martial
Martial characters are masters of physical combat. Short range, long range, unarmed, bladed weapons, name a style of fighting and there is a martial class that excels at it. They're also extremely well built physically, and are considerably tougher to take down on a 1-on-1 fight.


### Hit Points (HP) & Mana Points (MP)
A Martial character's maximum HP and MP are calculated as such:
- **HP at 1st Level:** 18 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP at 1st Level:** 3
- **HP gain per level after 1st:** 5 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP gain per level after 1st:** 3

### Attribute Score Increase
- **Gains ASI at levels:** 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 17, 19. (7 Total)

### Feats
A character from a martial class has access to all Matial Feats.

### Attacks
- **Simple Weapon Proficiency**: Any Martial character has proficiency with Simple Weapons
- **Martial Weapon Proficiency**: Any Martial character has proficiency with Martial weapons by default.
- **Extra Attack**: A Martial Character that reaches level 5 can attack 2 times on their turn when they use the attack action.
- **Attack of Oportunity:** a Martial Character is able to perform [[Combat Actions#Attack of Opportunity]].

<!-- idea: since caster scaling is usually quadratic and really strong (and off-casters above lv7 also have 2 attacks), maybe giving martial classes exclusive access to 3 attacks per turn could be cool -->

# Classes
classes are always from one of the archetypes, and add additional abilities that the character earns as they level. they also offer powers that the character may take at each level up after the first.

## List of Classes
Below is a list of all classes and a brief description of their abilities.

### Rogue
[[Class - Rogue]]
sneak attack

### Fighter
[[Class - Warrior]]
Extra Attack(2-3). Action surge

### Beast Warrior
[[Class - Beast Warrior]]
Beastly Rage. Savage Attack

### Juggernaut
[[Class - Juggernaut]]
Raise Guard. Powerful Strike.

### Battle Mage
[[Class - Spelgard]]
Spiritual Weapon. Lay on Hands

### Champion
[[Class - Champion]]
Smite! Lay on Hands

### Enhancer (Off-caster) (WIP)
off-caster who fights and can apply temporary buffs that make them hit harder and stronger. This could also be implemented as a Martial archetype, but i think it would be cooler as an Enhancer.

### Symbiote (Martial) (WIP)
Can suck off energy from enemies or host (self-damage). uses a lot of MP for abilities (buffs, attacks, utility skills)

### Beast Master (Off-Caster? really complicated) (WIP)
Can summon and control low CR animals.

### Medium/Summoner (WIP)
Can spend some time channeling and roll to see what comes out (who's available to be summoned). doesn't actually have long-term summons, it's just usual black magic.

### Bard (WIP)
Inspiration (flat bonus or dice? AoE or single target?). off-caster

## Creating a Class
1. Think of an interesting concept for what your class is and what Theme it plays to, what you want a character of that class to **feel like**, to whoever is playing it (from now referred as the class' **Theme**).
2. Decide if that class needs access to magic or not (and thus if it should be a caster/off-caster or a martial/specialist)
	1. It's common that as you progress with refining the idea and basic design of a class to come back to this step and rethink if you'd like or not for it to use spells (or whatever you reflavor them as) as their main way of interacting with the world as their class.
3. Think of 1 main mechanic (from now referred as the **Core Mechanic**) that character's from that class would use mainly to affect combat. This is the main way to express the **Theme**. Now express that Mechanic as a first level feature.
	1. Example: Beast Warrior's Rage, Rogue's Sneak Attack, Champion's Smite, Plantomancer's Herbology, Werebeast's Bestial Transformation.
4. Figure out what archetype works best with it's **Theme**
5. Think of a level-1 feature (almost always should be a skill that uses MP) to incorporate the main way that class expresses their **Theme**, and interacts with their **Core Mechanic**.
6. Then, if the class isn't from the Caster Archetype: Think of another feature relating to the class' **Theme** (but not necessarily it's **Core Mechanic**), and add that either as a level 2 or 3 class feature.
	1. In specific when designing Caster Classes it may make sense to add the class' **Core Mechanic** at a later level (such as with the Witch class' **Witch's Focus**). In that case this supplementary feature should be made, and added as a first level class feature.
7. Then think of 1 other feature to round out the **Theme** (something that also adds some non-combat flavor/utility). Add them as mid-game class features.
8. Now think of additional interesting new features and modifications to existing features that play to the class' **Theme**. Observe that while the **Core Mechanic** always has a combat effect, these mechanics don't necessarily have to all have to be obviously useful in combat (though most of them should have some in-combat use). This is a good place to think up of possible variations and specializations within members of the class. Add those as class feats.
	1. **Feat Groups:** In this effort of reinforcing class identity, it's interesting to think of a unique feat template and naming scheme, and apply that to create some different feats for the class, different from the singular feats created previously. Example: Plantomancer's **Herbomancy: \[Blank\]**, Spellgard's **Aura of \[Blank\]** and Beast Warrior's **Wild Rage: \[Blank\]**. It's recommended to have between 1 and 2 Feat groups per class.

### Recommended levels to add class features by archetype
| Archetype  | Core Feature | Auxiliary Feature | Mid-Game Feature |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Martial    | 1st          | 2nd               | 7th              |
| Specialist | 1st          | 3rd               | 7th              |
| Off-Caster | 1st          | 2nd               | 6th/8th          |
| Caster     | 1st          | -                 | 6th/8th          | 

Important tips:
- Class features should always scale with levels, usually as an optional additional MP cost to improve it's effect.
- Most class features should be active skills that cost MP to use (or rarely some other resource). Passive effects and skills that have no cost should exist as the exception, not the rule.
- Feats not from a feat group, on the other hand, usually aren't skills in and of themselves, but instead modify other class features or add in some passive effect or alternative way of using existing skills (possibly costing additional MP).
