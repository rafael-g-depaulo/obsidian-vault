### Magic Stone
*Cantrip (Truque)*
___
- **Execução:** padrão
- **Alcance:** toque
- **Alvo:** 1 a 3 pedras pequenas
- **Duração:** concentração.

You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged attack (DEX) with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, a pebble has a range of 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Whether the attack hits or misses, the spell then ends on the stone.

- **+3 PM:** Increase the damage by 1d6.
- **+1 PM:** Increase the number of pebbles by 1.
