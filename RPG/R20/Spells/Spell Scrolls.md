# Spell Scrolls
Spell Scrolls are consumable items that contain a spell. They can be used either to:
- Cast the spell
- Learn the spell

All spell scrolls have a tier. The tier of a spell scroll is equal to the MP cost of the spell stored inside it (including all spell modifiers).

## Casting a Spell from a Scroll
Any sentient creature may attempt to cast a spell from a scroll.

**Read Spell Scroll.** Action: make an Arcana skill check (DC 5 + tier). On a success the spell is cast, and the scroll is destroyed. On a failure by 5 or more, the scroll is destroyed. On a failure by 10 or more, the stored mana explodes in a 5sqr side square centered on the scroll, dealing 1d6 energy damage times the scroll tier and destroying the scroll.

If the creature reading the spell doesn't already have a spellcasting ability, they have -5 to their check. If the creature knows the language used to write the scroll, they have +2 to the check.

## Learning a Spell from a Scroll
A spellcaster may attempt to learn the spell stored in the scroll, if they have that ability (All Casters have this ability, while Off-casters don't by default). The reader must already be able to learn spells from that circle (a level 1 caster can only learn scrolls that contain spells of first circle or cantrips)

To attempt it the reader must spend 4 hours reading the scroll for each tier. At the end of this study (that can happen over multiple sessions), the reader makes an Arcana check, with DC 14 + tier. If they succeed, the reader learns that spell, and adds it to their spell list.

## Creating Spell Scrolls
To craft a spell scroll, a character must have ready materials (special parchment, magic ink, etc.) equal to 2gp per MP cost of the spell (including all spell modifiers, that the crafter decides during the crafting proccess). They then spend 4 hours per MP cost of the spell transcribing the spell. At the end of the proccess, they make an Arcana check (DC 10 + tier). If they succeed, the materials are expended and scroll is created. If they fail by 5 or more, the crafting materials are expended.

## Buying Spell Scrolls
In general, Spell Scrolls sold by merchants and other casters cost ~6gp per tier

OBS: maybe make it be different checks instead of all Arcana?
