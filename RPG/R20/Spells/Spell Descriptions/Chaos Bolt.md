INCORRECT_FORMAT_SPELL
### Chaos Bolt
*1º Círculo*
___
- **Execução:** padrão
- **Alcance:** 12sqr
- **Alvo:** 1 criatura
- **Duração:** imediato.

You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attacks damage type, as shown below.

| d8  | Damage Type |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1   | Acid        |
| 2   | Cold        |
| 3   | Fire        |
| 4   | Force       |
| 5   | Lightning   |
| 6   | Poison      |
| 7   | Psychic     |
| 8   | Thunder     |

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again. A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

- **+1PM:** aumenta o dano em 1d6
