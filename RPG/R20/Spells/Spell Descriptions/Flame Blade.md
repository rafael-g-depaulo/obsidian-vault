DESCRIPTION:
You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 fire damage.

The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
