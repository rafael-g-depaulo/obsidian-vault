DESCRIPTION:
The light of dawn shines down on a location you specify within range. Until the spell ends, a 30-foot-radius.40-foot-high cylinder of bright light glimmers there. This light is sunlight. When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the cylinder. If youâ€™re within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet as a Movement Action on your turn.
