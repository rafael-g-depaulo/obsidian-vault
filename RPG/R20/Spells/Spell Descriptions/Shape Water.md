# Shape Water

A Elemental Evil spell

Transmutation

Level: **Cantrip**  
Casting time: **1 Action**  
Range: **30 feet**  
Components: **S**  
Duration: **Instantaneous or 1 hour**  

---

You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube.  
You manipulate it in one of the following ways:  
  
• You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.  
  
• You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.  
  
• You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.  
  
• You freeze the water, provided that there are no crea- tures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.  
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
