### Green Flame Blade
*Truque*
___
- **Execução:** padrão
- **Alcance:** 6sqr
- **Alvo:** 1 criatura
- **Duração:** imediata.

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and green fire leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels.

- **+3PM:** increase both damages by +1d8
