DESCRIPTION:
This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting time you use determines whether the spell has the Overgrowth or the Enrichment effect below. 

**Overgrowth.** Choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 10sqr-radius Sphere centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through that area must spend 3 sqr movement for every 1 sqr it moves (if it only spends 1 or 2 it moves 1sqr). You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected. 

**Enrichment.** All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 365 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. They can benefit from only one Plant Growth per year.
