DESCRIPTION:
You plant four pieces of nonmagical ammunition—arrows or crossbow bolts—in the ground within range and lay magic upon them to protect an area. Until the spell ends, whenever a creature other than you comes within 6sqr of the ammunition for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, one piece of ammunition flies up to strike it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage. The piece of ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when no ammunition remains.
