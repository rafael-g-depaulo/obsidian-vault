- **Casting time:** 1 Movement Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration

You imbue a weapon you touch with holy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30—foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn’t already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration. As a Movement Action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded. At the end of each Ofits turns, a blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itselfon a success.
