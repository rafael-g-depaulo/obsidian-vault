### Spike Growth
*2º Círculo*
___
- **Execução:** padrão
- **Alcance:** 30sqr
- **Alvo:** quadrado de lado 4sqr
- **Duração:** concentração.

The ground in the radius centered twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.  
  
The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the spell is case must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
