You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes 1d8 necrotic damage.

- **+3 PM:** increase the damage by 2 dice
