CAST_TIME: padrão
TARGET: pessoal
DURATION: imediata.

DESCRIPTION:
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails.  
On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves be- fore then, it immediately takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.  
This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels.
