### Dissonant Whispers
*1º Círculo*
___
CAST_TIME: padrão
RANGE: 12sqr
TARGET: 1 criatura
DURATION: imediata.

You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain.  

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction , if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.
