You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain.  
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction , if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save. 

#### At higher level

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st
