### Compelled Duel
*1º Círculo*
___
- **Execução:** movimento
- **Alcance:** 6sqr
- **Alvo:** 1 criatura
- **Duração:** cena.

You attempt to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn’t restrict the target’s movement for that turn.  
  
The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.

- **+XPM:** you gain an offensive buff against the target
- **+XPM:** both you and the target have +# movement speed when running towards eachother
