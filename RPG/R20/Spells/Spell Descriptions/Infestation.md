### Infestation
*Truque*
___
- **Execução:** padrão
- **Alcance:** 6sqr
- **Alvo:** 1 criatura
- **Duração:** imediata.

You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it takes 1d6 poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1., north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.  

- **+1PM:** increases the damage by 1d6 (limitado por círculo máximo)
