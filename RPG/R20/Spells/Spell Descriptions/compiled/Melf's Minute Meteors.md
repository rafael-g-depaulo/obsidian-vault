DESCRIPTION:
You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell—and as a movement action on each of your turns thereafter—you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 15sqr of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
