DESCRIPTION:
A strong wind (20 miles per hour) blows around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for the spell’s duration.  
The wind has the following effects:  
- It deafens you and other creatures in its area.  
- It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.  
- The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.  
- The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if they pass in or out of the wind.  
- It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.
