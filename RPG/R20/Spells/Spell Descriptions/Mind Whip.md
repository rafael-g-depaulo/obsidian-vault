DESCRIPTION:
You psychically lash out at one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 psychic damage, and it can't take a reaction until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, it must spend it's movement action trying to resist the confusion. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers none of the spell's other effects.
