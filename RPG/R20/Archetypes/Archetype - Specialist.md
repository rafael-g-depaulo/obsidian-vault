## Specialist
Specialists are exactly what the name implies, incredibly specialized combatants that, instead of focusing on complete mastery of the arcane, martial combat or even a balance of both, have a single niche proficiency or knowledge they use to dominate the battlefield in their own way. Rogues, Artificers, Gunslingers, Alchemists, all of these are primary examples of how a Specialist Class works.
