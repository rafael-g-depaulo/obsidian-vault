## Caster
A Caster's main strength is variety, versatility and the raw power of their spells.

### Hit Points (HP) & Mana Points (MP)
A Caster's maximum HP and MP are calculated as such:
- **HP at 1st Level:** 8 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP at 1st Level:** 6 + their spellcasting attribute modifier
- **HP gain per level after 1st:** 2 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP gain per level after 1st:** 6

### Attribute Score Increase
- **Gains ASI at levels:** 4, 8, 12, 16, 19. (5 Total)

### Feats
A Caster has access to all Caster Feats.

### Spells
- **Prepared Spells**: After every rest, a Caster choses up to half (rounded up) of their spells. Those are considered prepared, and they may only cast those spells until their next rest. If a Caster tries to cast a spell they know but have not memorized, they must pass an Arcana Check (DC 20 + the spell's MP cost). On a fail, they spend the MP and the casting time, but the skill fails.
- **Cantrips**: Casters can learn cantrips (0 MP cost spells)
- **Known Spells**: A Caster knows 3 spells at lv1, and learns a new spell every level after that. Whenever they learn a new spell, the spell's circle can't exceed the value in the table below:

##### Caster maximum spell circle per Level
| Level | Spell's Circle |
|:-----:|:--------------:|
|  1-2  |       1        |
|  3-4  |       2        |
|  5-6  |       3        |
|  7-8  |       4        |
| 9-10  |       5        |
| 11-12 |       6        |
| 13-14 |       7        |
| 15-16 |       8        |
