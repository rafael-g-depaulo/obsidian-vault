# Archetypes

All player characters have a class they belong to. That class, whichever it may be, is associated with an archetype. A class' archetype deterimines what weapons they have access to, their maximum HP and MP, their spellcasting capability (if any), among other things. A complete list of the archetypes and their characteristics can be seen below.

## Full-Caster
A full-caster's main strength is variety, versatility and the raw power of their spells.

### Attribute Score Increase
- **Gains ASI at levels:** 4, 8, 12, 16, 19. (5 Total)

### Feats
A full-caster has access to all Caster Feats.

### Hit Points (HP) & Mana Points (MP)
A full-caster's maximum HP and MP are calculated as such:
- **HP at 1st Level:** 8 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP at 1st Level:** 6 + their spellcasting attribute modifier
- **HP gain per level after 1st:** 2 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP gain per level after 1st:** 6

### Spells
- **Prepared Spells**: After every rest, a Full-Caster choses up to half (rounded down) of their Full-Caster spells. Those are considered prepared, and they may only cast those spells until their next rest. If a Full-caster tries to cast a spell they know but have not memorized, they must pass an Arcana Check (DC 20 + the spell's MP cost). On a fail, they spend the MP and the casting time, but the skill fails.
- **Cantrips**: Full-casters can learn cantrips (0 MP cost spells)
- **Known Spells**: A Full-caster knows 4 spells at lv1, and learns a new spell every level after that. Whenever they learn a new spell, the spell's base MP Cost can't exceed the value in the table below:

##### Full-Caster maximum spell cost per Level
| Level | MP Cost |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 1-2   | 1       |
| 3-4   | 2       |
| 5-6   | 3       |

| 11-12 | 8       |
| 13-14 | 10      |
| 15-16 | 12      |
| 17-20 | 15      |

## Half-Caster
A Half-Caster isn't quite as prodigious with their raw spellcasting as a fullcaster, but all Half-Caster classes have their own special tricks and techniques to turn the tables in their favor, be it a druid's Wild Shape or a sorceror's Metamagic.

### Attribute Score Increase
