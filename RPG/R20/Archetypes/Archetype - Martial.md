## Martial
Martial characters are masters of physical combat. Short range, long range, unarmed, bladed weapons, name a style of fighting and there is a martial class that excels at it. They're also extremely well built physically, and are considerably tougher to take down on a 1-on-1 fight.

### Hit Points (HP) & Mana Points (MP)
A Martial character's maximum HP and MP are calculated as such:
- **HP at 1st Level:** 18 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP at 1st Level:** 3
- **HP gain per level after 1st:** 5 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP gain per level after 1st:** 3

### Attribute Score Increase
- **Gains ASI at levels:** 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 17, 19. (7 Total)

### Feats
A character from a martial class has access to all Matial Feats.

### Attacks
- **Simple Weapon Proficiency**: Any Martial character has proficiency with Simple Weapons
- **Martial Weapon Proficiency**: Any Martial character has proficiency with Martial weapons by default.
- **Extra Attack**: A Martial Character that reaches level 5 can attack 2 times on their turn when they use the attack action.
- **Attack of Oportunity:** a Martial Character is able to perform [[Combat Actions#Attack of Opportunity]].

<!-- idea: since caster scaling is usually quadratic and really strong (and off-casters above lv7 also have 2 attacks), maybe giving martial classes exclusive access to 3 attacks per turn could be cool -->
