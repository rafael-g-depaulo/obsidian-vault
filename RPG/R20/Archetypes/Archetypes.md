# Archetypes

All player characters have a class they belong to. That class, whichever it may be, is associated with an archetype. A class' archetype deterimines what weapons they have access to, their maximum HP and MP, their spellcasting capability (if any), among other things. A complete list of the archetypes and their characteristics can be seen below.
