## Hide Action
All characters can perform the **Hide** action:

**Hide.** Movement: Make a stealth skill check. If you're not beat by the contested roll (perception/investigation at DM's discretion) or passive roll of a creature, you're hidden from them. While hidden:
- you have advantage to attack creatures that you are hidden from
- a creature that you are hidden from has disadvantage on attacks against you (they still have to guess your location)

**Esconder.** Movimento: Faça uma rolagem de furtividade. Você está escondido contra criaturas que não passarem num teste para de procurar. Enquanto escondido:
- Você tem vantagem para atacar criaturas que não te acharam.
- Criaturas que não te acharam tem desvantagem para te atacar (elas ainda tem que atacar na direção certa para terem uma chance de te acertar).
