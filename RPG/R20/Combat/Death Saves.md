When a character reaches or goes below 0hp they start rolling death saving throws at the start of their turns. (1d20 no modifiers, DC 10). If a character goes below half of their maximum HP into the negatives, they instantly die.

Being healed removes 1 failed save, or gives 1 successful save if there are no failed ones. If the character goes above 0HP they regain consciousness.

If they hit 3 successes, they stabilize at 1HP and regain consciousness at the end of the scene. An ally can perform a Medicine check as an Action (DC 10) to wake up a stabilized unconscious character.
