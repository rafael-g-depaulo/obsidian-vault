Grappling is a kind of melee attack. The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, an Athletics check contested by the targetâ€™s Athletics or Acrobatics check (the target chooses the skill to use).
