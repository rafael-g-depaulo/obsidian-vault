# Combat


## Round
For each round of combat (equivalent to ~6s of real time), each character takes their turn, in initiative order. Some items, spells and abilities might affect these numbers, but by default every character has, during their turn, access to:

- 1 Action
- 1 Movement Action
- Any number of Free Actions

## Common Actions
### Attack
![[Attacks, Defense and Save DC_s]]

### Grappling
Grappling is a kind of melee attack. The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, an Athletics check contested by the targetâ€™s Athletics or Acrobatics check (the target chooses the skill to use).

<!-- ### TODO: reference more stuff from T20 (e.g. shoving) -->

### Movement
During their turn, a character can spend their movement action to move up to their movement speed. (to calculate PC's movement speed, check [[Movement]])
