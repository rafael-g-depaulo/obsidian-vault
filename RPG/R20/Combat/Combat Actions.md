## Combat Actions

### Endurance
**Endurance (Resistência):** Movement action (2MP): for the rest of the scene, all non-psychic damage you take that's equal or below your Guard is reduced to 0. This does not affect "DoT" or environmental damage (e.g.: burning, walking on a corrosive substance, bleeding, gradual poisoning, etc.)

OBS: the DM may rule that any specific instance of damage may or may not ignore Endurance depending on the situation, at their discretion.

### Uncanny Dodge
Below is the definition of the Uncanny Dodge ability, that all characters can perform:

%%
English
**Uncanny Dodge ("de Raspão"):** (when taking damage) Reaction (3PM): ignore the damage, and increase the cost of this by 3PM. You can't use Uncanny Dodge if it costs more than your **Dodge**.
%%
**"de Raspão".** (tomando dano) Reação (3PM): Ignore o dano, e aumente o custo dessa habilidade em +3PM pela cena. Você não pode usar **"de Raspão"** se custar mais que a sua **Evasão**.


Example Use: Fibi has 8 Guard and 7 Dodge. Fibi has 18 AC (someone trying to attack them has to roll a 18 or higher to hit them), can use Uncanny Dodge up to 2 times per scene, and their Endurance allows them to shrug off attacks of 8 or less points of damage. If they use Endurance and take 3 attacks dealing 7, 14 and 5 damage, the first and third attacks have their damage reduced to 0.

### Attack of Opportunity
If your character has the ability to do so, they can perform an attack of opportunity.

**Attack of Opportunity**: Reaction (An enemy leaves your melee range, 0MP): You can make an attack against the enemy immediately as they leave your melee range.

### Movement
During their turn, a character can spend their movement action to move up to their movement speed. (to calculate PC's movement speed, check [[Movement]]). 

### Dash
Any character can use their Major Action in combat to perform another movement action.

### Attack
Any character can use their Major Action in combat to perform the Attack Action. When doing so, they can perform a melee or ranged attack (unarmed or with a weapon they are wielding), or perform a [[Maneuvers]]
