# Combat Actions

## Endurance
**Endurance:** Movement action (2MP): for the rest of the scene, all damage you take that's equal or below your Guard is reduced to 0 (the DM may rule otherwise for specific damage types, such as psychic damage). 

## Uncanny Dodge
Below is the definition of the Uncanny Dodge ability, that all characters can perform:

**Uncanny Dodge:** (when taking damage) Reaction (3PM): ignore the damage, and increase the cost of this by 3PM. You can't use Uncanny Dodge if it costs more than your **Dodge**.

Example Use: Fibi has 8 Guard and 7 Dodge. Fibi has 18 AC (someone trying to attack them has to roll a 18 or higher to hit them), can use Uncanny Dodge up to 2 times per scene, and their Endurance allows them to shrug off attacks of 8 or less points of damage. If they use Endurance and take 3 attacks dealing 7, 14 and 5 damage, the first and third attacks have their damage reduced to 0.
