# Combat
## Round
For each round of combat (equivalent to ~6s of real time), each character takes their turn, in initiative order. Some items, spells and abilities might affect these numbers, but by default every character has, during their turn, access to:

- 1 Action
- 1 Movement Action
- Any number of Free Actions
