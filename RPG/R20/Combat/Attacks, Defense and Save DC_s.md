## Attacks

### Physical Attacks
To make a physical attack you first roll to hit. If you're proficient with the weapon being used, you add your [[Proficiency]] bonus for your current level (copy of the proficiency table included at the end of the page).

If making a melee attack:
  - **1d20 + proficiency bonus + Strength modifier**

If making a ranged attack:
  - **1d20 + proficiency bonus + Dexterity modifier**

If a melee weapon has the *finesse* property you can use Dexterity for the attack roll instead of Strength. (see: Equipment section).

If the attack hit, you deal damage equal to the damage dice for the weapon, plus the modifier used for the attack roll.

Example: Molly, an 8th level character proficient with simple weapons and 15(+2) DEX would have the following attack and damage rolls with a dagger:
- Attack Roll: 1d20+6
- Damage Roll: 1d4+2

### Spell Attacks
To make a spell attack you first roll to hit. The roll is determined by the following formula:
  - **1d20 + proficiency bonus + Spellcasting modifier**
	
Unlike physical attacks, spell attacks in general don't add the caster's spellcasting modifier to the damage roll.

Some spells use a spell save DC instead. For that, see the Save DC Section below.

## Saves
For some spell and other abilities certain classes have an enemy has to roll ot try to escape from the ability. The DC for that roll is determined by the formula below:

**8 + proficiency modifier + relevant attribute modifier**

Example: Ynit, a level 6 Mage with 15 INT (their spellcasting attribute) would have a spell save DC of 8 + 3 + 2 = 13.

### Rolling Saves
Whenever a player character has to resist an effect, they perform a Save Roll with a certain attribute. A character's class determines what attributes they have proficiency in saves with. If a character is proficient with a save, the roll formula is:

**1d20 + proficiency modifier + relevant attribute modifier**

If they aren't proficient in saves with that attribute, the roll is:

**1d20 + relevant attribute modifier**

## Defense (AC)
<div></div>
When an attack or spell has a roll instead of a save DC, the chalenge rating it should meet to hit the target is the target's Defense. The target's defense (also known as armor class) is calculated as:

- **10 + Maximum(Dodge, Guard)**

### Guard
The formula for a character's Guard is:

- **Equipment bonus + Constituition modifier**

Besides contributing to a character's Defense, Guard also allows them to use *Endurance*.

**Endurance:** a character may spend a movement action 2MP: for the rest of the scene, all damage they take that's equal or below their guard is reduced to 0 (the DM may rule otherwise for specific damage types, such as psychic damage). 

### Dodge
The formula for a character's Dodge is:

- **Equipment bonus + Dexterity modifier**

Besides contributing to a character's Defense, Dodge also allows them to use *Uncanny Dodge*.

**Uncanny Dodge:** a character may, upon taking damage, spend a reaction and 3PM to halve the incoming damage. You can't spend more PM using Uncanny Dodge in a scene than you have Dodge.

Example: Fibi has 8 Guard and 7 Dodge. Fibi has 18 AC (someone trying to attack them has to roll a 18 or higher to hit them), can use Uncanny Dodge up to 2 times per scene, and their Endurance allows them to shrug off attacks of 8 or less points of damage. If they use Endurance and take 3 attacks dealing 7, 14 and 5 damage, the first and third attacks have their damage reduced to 0.
