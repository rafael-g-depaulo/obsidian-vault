	- ssa(dead-energy) and tnaki(blood-energy):
		- the orcs believe that everything that moves or happens does so by using one of two
			kinds of energy: magic and blood energy. blood energy is used only by animals,
			to move and to sustain life, and it is earned by eating life (plants/animals).
			magic energy is created by nature and plants, and some animals can harvest this
			energy from its surroundings, and use it, or sometimes even store it. it cannot
			however, they believe, be used as blood-energy, or the other way around

		- the orcs believe that the only chance they have at reincarnation is by dying in battle,
			killed by blood-energy. beying killed by dead-energy, like in an acident, or by disease
			or a magic spell, impedes them from reincarnating as another animal by the blood-energy.
			Being killed by dead energy means that they will be consumed by the dead energy around
			them, decomposing, becoming part of the ssa around them, and thus ceasing to exist as life.

- General Lore:
	- name structure:
		- in Kuff's tribe, naming structure was [NAME]'[CLAN].
		- [NAME] could be substituted, later in life, if the individual happened to be reborn by
			some ritual or experience (like being a war hero and changing your name to fit accordingly)
		- [CLAN] isn't just about family, but can also design a persons job, class, vocation or social group.
			a persons clan can be the one they were born in or a clan they've created themselves.

	- Tnak clan:
			The oldest clan of Kuffs tribe, though not the strongest anymore. They used to be the best warriors in the horde, but after
		a few centuries they stopped being so involved in the horde. nowadays, they are mostly blacksmiths, with just a few venturing
		into other jobs inside the tribe.

- Important Characters:

	- Llat'Dratsab (formerly known as Llat'Ihctib):
			Kuffs best friend, Llat was born into the Ihctib clan of warriors. With a staggering 3,5m after he fully developed,
		rumours spread about his blood. Most agreed that he had some ogre in him, and probably a bit of troll and maybe even giant.
		some even jokingly say that his father fucked a sleeping dragon, that one day took a shit, looked down, and suddenly Llat
		was there.
			Llat always liked Kuff, because the little guy looked up to Llat, and because the other orcs made fun of little Kuff,
		and Llat liked to defend his buddy. Kuff also made him a really good knife one day (Kuff said something about a finally
		being recognised as a smith and something about the knife being special, but Llat didnt listen, as he stared at the cool 
		toy his friend gave him), and Llat used it kill his first enemy. They then drank to it, and it was nice.
			Other orcs didn't like Kuff's work though, and said he was a bad blacksmith. Even worse, some said he was cursed.
		Ssaesh they called him. fuck them. One of them was talking shit to Kuff, so Llat chalenged him and killed him in battle.
		He used the knife Kuff gave him. It felt heavier than the last time. The opponents mother came to Llat to thank him for
		sending her son back to Tnaki through a worthy battle. Llat said it was ok. Her son did give him a fun battle, so Llat
		forgave him in the end. The other orcs still hated Kuff though, they Just stopped calling him Ssaesh in front of Llat.
			One day Llat asked Kuff to make him an axe (Llat liked axes, they were good for decapitating and decepating, and those
		were very fun things to do). He used a few of the other axes the tribe had, but they were a bit too light, too "soft",
		and their handles were too short. Kuff made him a beautifil axe (Llat almost understood those weird warriors that named
		their weapons when he saw the axe). It was still a bit too light, but it was as sharp as it needed to be.
			Llat even felt different when he used it. He had more energy, his bloodlust grew larger, and his reputation expanded
		to even beyond the tribe. More than once whole groups of enemies ran away when they saw Llat and his axe. They screamed.
		Llat didn't know what they were screaming though, as he looked for enemies to fight. With every battle, he got stronger
		and more fierce, his axe's blade growing heavier and heavier.
			With his new axe, Llat became a sort of hero amongst the tribe. He mated with a good portion of the strongest females,
		got promoted time and again, and was now in the highest rank of the tribe's horde (*see: Lore->Tribe Groups). The chief
		wanted Llat to be the next chief, but Llat didnt like the responsibility, he just liked to fight.
			Eventually Llat's achievements in battle (crowned by the time he split an enemy general in half height-wise, roared
		and made their soldiers flee in fear) granted him the right to ascend from Ihctib and forge his own clan, wich he named
		Dratsab. All of his children were granted the choice of changing clan, and they all accepted.
			One day Llat was leading the horde against a group of dwarves. Their leader was a fierce paladin, that even a few of
		Llat's orcs knew from stories of her strenght. She was a paladin, known for her prowess in battle and sheer strenght. Llat
		hadn't heard of her. or he had, he's not good with remembering things. He's good with fights though, and he wanted to fight
		the dwarf paladin. As soon as Llat saw her taking one of his warriors down and stabbing him through the heart, Llat knew she
		was the one. He charged towards the paladin, axe in hands, swinging from side to side, heavier than ever. Llat looked down
		to his meal, swinged himself up and struck down.
			A thunderous, shriek of metal against metal, followed by an explosion of wood tearing, engolfed in a tanakke light.
		Llat looked down, to the stick he held with two hands, and the warrior in front of him, with a partially destroyed shield
		raised (and glowing. The fucker probably had ssa enchantment on her shield. Pussy). He felt dizzy, like he drank a whole
		keg of ale. weird. He was drinking something, but it wasn't ale. it was really good, and it was really bad. he looked a
		little further down, to himself. he was stuck in the chest. his chest. drinking himself.

	- Edud Dloc Mfle:
		Little is known about the old elf. And elves are said to live for centuries, so some wonder what age does Edud Dloc Mfle
	have to consider himself old for an elf.

- Story:
		Nascido, crescido e treinado como um ferreiro do clã tnak, Kuff'Tnak era baixo para com orc, com apenas 2,39m.
	Kuff tinha muita habilidade na forja pelo menos, e tinha proficiência na forja de todos os tipos de armas melee. Suas
	espadas eram mais afiadas, suas lanças perfuravam mais, seus machados separavam membros mais facilmente. Só tinha um
	problema com as armas do Kuff: Ninguém conseguia empunhá-las. Elas começavam balanceadas para um orc (só um anão ou um
	humano especialmente forte conseguiria empunhar uma arma designed para um orc como as de Kuff), mas conforme eram usadas
	em batalha, ou mesmo ficavam paradas no armazém, elas ficavam mais e mais pesadas. eventualmente todas as peças forjadas
	por Kuff ficavam pesadas demais para serem usadas em batalha por qualquer um. Com uma únca exceção: Llat'Ihctib. (*see: 
	Important Characters)
		Kuff era pequeno, e ele era maltratado por causa disso. Os outros orcs ficavam batendo nele, e ameaçando cortar as
	orelhas dele. Mandavam ele voltar pra montanha, com o resto dos anões. Todos menos Llat. Llat era grande, e forte. Ele 
	protegia Kuff, e Kuff gostava disso. Llat gostava de kuff. Kuff não sabia porque, mas Kuff não se importava. Kuff tinha
	um amigo, e isso era suficiente.
		Kuff não gostava dos outros orcs, então Kuff passava seu tempo na frente da forja. Kuff tentou aprender a lutar. Kuff
	não gostou muito, porque os outros orcs ficavam incomodando ele. Ele não era fraco em comparação com eles, mas ele não
	tinha experiência, e eles zombavam ele de qualquer jeito. Então kuff ficava na forja.
		Depois de 4 anos como ajudante de ferreiro, Kuff ganhou um pedaço de ferro anão. O ferreiro chefe entregou pra ele e
	disse pra ele fazer alguma coisa. Kuff era um ferreiro agora. Mas o chefe ferreiro não gostava muito de Kuff (alguma coisa
	estranha nos trabalhos de Kuff, o chefe não sabia o que, só sabia que era estranho), então Kuff ganhou pouco minério. Kuff
	fez uma faca, porque tinha pouco, e deu pro Llat. Kuff não gostava da maioria dos orcs, mas Kuff gostava do Llat, então
	ele fez a faca pra ele. Llat gostou, e Kuff gostou que Llat gostou. Eles beberam pra comemorar.


		Kuff gostava de forjar armas, e os orcs gostavam das armas dele. Por um tempo. Com tempo e uso, as armas ficavam pesadas
	demais, ai ninguém conseguia usar. Quando um orc tentava usar uma arma pesada demais, ele quase sempre morria. Ele morria
	o pior tipo de morte. Ele morria por ssa. Kuff andava com a horda, levando o carrinho de armas (a maioria das armas dos orcs
	quebram fácil. orcs fortes, mas nem sempre bons ferreiros. armas de inimigos caidos também frágeis). Ele via o que acontecia.
	Ssa dos feiticeiros e magos humanos e elfos mudava de caminho e acertava os orcs carregando as armas de Kuff. Raio caia do
	céu e acertava eles. Pegava fogo e morria queimado. Orc que usava arma de Kuff não nova morria, sem poder voltar ao Tnake e
	lutar de novo.
		Orcs pararam de usar armas de Kuff, mesmo as novas. Chamavam kuff de Kuff'Ssaesh ou Kuff'Ssah em vez de Kuff'Tnak. Botavam
	fogo na tenda de Kuff. Só não chamavam Kuff pra batalha porque depois de matar Kuff Llat ia chamar pra batalha 	e matar quem
	matou Kuff. Ninguém usava armas de Kuff, então Kuff não servia mais de ferreiro. Kuff não sabia fazer mais nada, e chamavam
	Kuff de preguiçoso que não faz nada. Chamavam Kuff de parasita. Chamavam Kuff de verme. Até Llat pedir uma coisa pra Kuff.


		Um dia, Llat pediu pra Kuff fazer um machado. Llat gostava de machados, mas não queria usar os machados da tribo. Llat 
	queria um machado do Kuff. Kuff ficou feliz. Kuff podia fazer uma arma. Kuff podia ser util. Kuff podia ajudar Llat. Assim
	Kuff mata 3 problemas com 1 ataque. Kuff fez um machado. Um machado grande que nem Llat. Kuff vendeu sua tenda, sua bigorna e
	tudo que tinha. Kuff só não vendeu Kuff. Kuff comprou ferro anão. Kuff comprou madeira de floresta de elfo. Kuff usou
	ferramenta emprestada, mas Kuff fez o machado. 3,29m de altura. dois lados que cortam. Cabeça pesada e afiada. Kuff tomou
	cuidado pra fazer o machado. Kuff colocou tudo o que Kuff tinha no machado. Kuff queria fazer um bom trabalho.
		Llat gostou do machado. Llat usou o machado bastante em batalha. Llat parou de usar outras armas. Llat disse que gostava
	de usar o machado, que dava mais fome pra ele durante Tnakuoy. Ele venceu muito com o machado. Histórias foram feitas sobre
	Llat. Músicas foram cantadas sobre Llat. Llat não sabia disso, ele não prestava atenção. Inimigos tinham medo do "Orc Gigante
	do Machado Sangrento". Llat derrotou muitos inimigos. Llat fez muitos filhos. Llat enfrentou um general humano em batalha.
	Diziam que o general era poderoso. Diziam que o general não tinha medo. Llat cortou o general. Kuff viu de longe, carregando o
	carrinho de armas. O machado desceu. Acertou entre o ombro e o pescoço. Entre duas partes da armadura. Llat é muito bom em
	acertar o lugar certo. Cortou pela malha de ferro. Era malha de ferro dos anões? Parecia bem forte, mesmo sendo grande demais
	para um anão. A armadura não era de ferro dos anões. Se fosse, teria parado o machado quando ele chegou no topo do peito. Ou
	quando machado chegou no topo da barriga. Ou antes de chegar na cintura. Pelo menos teria deixado o machado lento, e ele não
	ficaria preso no chão. Parecia que o machado dormiu depois de comer. Os humanos confiavam no general. Eles viram ele. Eles
	viram Llat. Eles correram.
		Llat deixou tribo feliz com vitória. Tribo deixou Llat criar clã dele. Llat disse pra Kuff entrar. Kuff não podia. Orcs iam
	matar Kuff se Kuff dissesse sim. Mas Kuff feliz. Kuff ganhou dinheiro porque Kuff fez arma de Llat. Kuff ferreiro de novo. Kuff
	comprou tenda nova (cheiro bom, diferente da outra). Amigo de Kuff chefe da horda. Kuff feliz. Kuff feliz até acidente.


		Kuff ouviu lendas dela. Anão chefe de um grupo de guerreiros. Paladino com escudo encantado. Anão mais forte que existe,
	eles diziam. Mas ninguém mais forte que Llat, anão ou orc. Kuff preocupado, mas Kuff não sabia porque. Kuff pediu pra olhar
	machado de Llat dia antes. Machado pesado. MAchado afiado. Machado estranha sensação. Machado muito pesado.
		Llat estava tão grande. Llat não usava armadura, Llat preferia ficar sem, como maioria dos orcs. Todo orc da horda olhava
	pra Llat. Alguns chefes da horda faziam discurso. Llat não precisava. Llat ia na frente e orcs seguiam. Kuff viu inimigos na
	distancia. Kuff viu Paladina. Kuff viu Llat correndo. Chão tremia, inimigos também. Llat levantou o machado pro céu, segurando
	com as duas mãos. Machado cobriu o sol. Tudo vermelho. Tudo menos paladina. Ela amarela, brilhando. Ssa em volta dela, por que
	os outros não veem? Perigoso atacar paladina agora. Escudo paladina brilhando forte. Machado desceu. Escudo subiu. Brilho forte,
	vermelho e amarelo. cabo do machado quebrou. Machado girou, e acertou Llat. Machado fincado no peito, brilhando tanak. Llat estava
	pálido. Tnak de Llat molhando machado. Machado ficando seco, brilhando tanakke. Machado bebendo Llat. Quando Kuff chegou, Llat
	morto. Pior, Llat sem tnak. Llat virou Ssah.
		Orcs fugiram. Chegando na tribo, Kuff foi algemado. Kuff culpado. Orelha direita Kuff cortada. Diziam pra matar Kuff, pra
	torturar Kuff. Diziam pra matar Kuff com machado de Llat. Machado tão pequeno agora. Chefe decidiu. Chefe andou pra Kuff, segurando
	machado de Kuff. Machado parecia tão leve, tão calmo. Chefe jogou machado na frente de Kuff. Chefe soltou Kuff. Chefe falou:

			" Llat'Dratsab morreu. Dratsab virou Ssah. Culpa sua. Kuff'Tnak não é mais. Não é mais ferreiro. Não é mais Tnak. Não é mais
		da tribo. Não é mais orc. Kuff'Ssah é. É de fora da tribo. É coisa. É Ssaesh. Sai da tribo, Kuff'Ssah. Sai, e não volta."

		Kuff pegou machado, e Kuff saiu.

	
		It was uhn. Good thing there was Keuhn, because Kuff didn't make a fire. Kuff didn't want to do it. Kuff didn't want anything.
	Kuff didn't know what to do. Kuff wanted Llat. Kuff looked to the axe. It was smaller now the handle broke. Stupid elf wood. Stupid
	paladin. Stupid Kuff. The axe reflected the Keuhn, but a bit more red. Still hungry, axe? You drank Llat already, are you still
	hungry? Restless axe. Restless like Llat. Kuff is thinking. Kuff doesnt know what he is thinking about, but he is thinking. Kuff
	doesnt like thinking this much. Kuff isn't very good at it. Kuff gets distracted when he thinks to hard. Kuff thinks so hard he
	doesnt notice the owlbear until its too close.
		"Hold my handle Kuff". "Yes Llat" is what kuff thought, as he took the axe and swung it, cutting the enemy in its front leg. The
	beast took a step back and stood up. "Let's do it". Kuff grinned, and started attacking. "This is fun Llat! Do you always have this
	much fun in battle?". "Yeah, but it usually lasts longer". Kuff looked down, as tanakke faded from his eyes. he didn't remember
	cutting the thing so many times. Kuff looked at the axe. it looked nice. Drinking the last bit of blood still in the blade.
		"Are you Llat?". The axe didn't answer. It felt like Llat, but like not Llat too. Kuff was starting to see why some weapons have
	names. Kuff looked down to the animal, to what remained after the axe fed. "Tnakiesh". The axe shined tanak. "Good name. Llat would
	like".

	
		It's been a lot of time. Orcs didn't let Kuff use a beard in tribe because they said Kuff wasn't good enough for a beard. Kuff
	had a beard now. Because he can. And because not good idea shave with Tnakiesh. Kuff mostly walked alone and hunted. Humans afraid
	of Kuff. Elfs are jerks. Orcs usually recognise and run or try to kill Kuff. Dwarves are rare, and Kuff cant work as a blacksmith,
	so it doesn't matter. Then Kuff walks into a forest. this forest different. No tracks, different animals. Ssa in the air more than
	other places. This elf forest. Kuff know Kuff right, because after some time Kuff see old elf. Elfs always old, but his more old. Elf
	talked to Kuff. Kuff asked how old. Kuff not sure if that was real number. Old elf name is Edud Dloc Mfle. Hard name. Kuff used to 2
	word name. 3 word gets confusing sometimes. Kuff asked to just use Edud. Edud Dloc Mfle said no.
		It's been some time. Edud Dloc Mfle and Kuff talked a lot. Kuff said who Kuff is, Edud Dloc Mfle said who he is. Edud Dloc Mfle
	is old elf. He tired of elfs, so he travels and does stuff. Kuff agrees, elfs annoying. Edud Dloc Mfle traveling, seing things. He
	offers Kuff job, so Kuff accepts. He has lot of coins. Buys Kuff travel anvil and hammer. They travel.


		Kuff and Edud Dloc Mfle travel a lot. Edud Dloc Mfle taught things to Kuff, about Ssa. Kuff learned that he put ssa into weapons.
	Edud Dloc Mfle put a tatto on Kuff. Now Kuff could smith again.  They spend time close to dwarves, then close to forests, then mountains
	and desert and plains. Kuff liked dwarves. Kuff learned a bit of how they smith stuff. Kuff learned a bit of their language, but not
	much. Easier than elvish. Weird flowery language with stupid way to say words. Dwarf language easier, closer to Orc language. Just
	few words though. many languages, hard to learn. More fun to smith stuff. And fight, but Kuff not find things to fight. Kuff want to
	make more weapons. It's fun.
		Kuff and master make way to vulcano. Kuff now call Edud Dloc Mfle master. It easier than Edud Dloc Mfle. People say golden dragons
	used to live in the vulcano. master say people wrong. It was red dragons. Kuff felt inspired. Kuff took ore from close by. Kuff went
	into the vulcano, and used it's heat to make Mealfdrah. It reminded Kuff of the time he spent with Dwrafs. That's why he named it with
	their tongue. Kuff met with master, showed him Mealfdrah for him to mark like master marked Tnakiesh and Kuff, and they marched on.

	(i couldn't think of a backstor for Ailat Ihneg or Da'Inkei yet, or maybe ever, so this is a placeholder)

		Kuff felt weird. Kuff liked master. Kuff liked traveling. Kuff liked making weapons. Why doesn't Kuff feel well? Why does Kuff want
	to go away? Kuff talk to master about it. Kuff and master talk. Kuff understand. Kuff is Orc, still. Kuff wants to fight. Kuff want
	more than fight. Elf fight. Dwarf fight. Halfling fight. Kuff is Orc. Kuff want tnako.
		Kuff was saying bye to master. Kuff notice one thing. Kuff orc, but Kuff not have clan. Orcs said Kuff is Kuff'Ssaesh. Old chief
	said Kuff is Kuff'Ssah. Kuff not Ssah, and not Ssaesh. Kuff learned more about Ssa. Master teached Kuff. Ssah exist, and Ssaesh exist,
	but Kuff not either. Kuff think. Think is hard.
		Kuff has idea! Kuff make own clan. Kuff not Llat to deserve clan, but Kuff still orc. And if Kuff orc, Kuff need clan. Kuff not in 
	tribe, so Kuff cant have tribe name. Kuff different because other orcs use Tnake, but Kuff use Tnake and Ssa. Kuff use Ssa. Ssa. Kuff
	had second idea! Kuff very smart, two ideas in one day.

		And so, he said bye to his master and took his weapons. Kuff'Ssa left, in search of tnako.

- Skills:
	- Kuff can awaken his weapons, by calling their names and weakening their seals. (counts as minor action) 
	- Kuff can "release" his weapons' seals by reciting the incantations that Ehdud Dloc Mfle taught him. (counts as major action)
	- (ULTIMATE): Kuff can recite the special incantation Ehdud Dloc Mfle gave him to release his own seal. When doing so, Kuff
		can dual wield any of his weapons, and his other skills are powered up. Any weapon Wielded by Kuff while on this state is
		automatically released, and it's effects on Kuff's mind is amplified.
			OBS: Weapon don't go back to sleep until Kuff goes back to normal(*see: Weapons->Tnakiesh & Weapons->Da'Inkei)
			OBS2: If wielding Ailat Ihneg, "Tempest" and "Gale" are activated automatically, and last until Kuff goes back to
			normal. (*see: Weapons->Ki'id & Slawb & Ailat Ihneg)
	- While a weapon is awakened or released, kuff may use it's skills, if learned. (*see: Weapons->(*)->Skills for the skills)
		(*see: Important Characters->Ehdud Dloc Mfle)
		(*see: Seals and Incantations)
		(*see: Weapons)
- Perks & Flaws:
	- Blacksmith's Expertise: given his experience with weapon and armor crafting, Kuff can analise a metal equipment
		he sees, check if the enemy has chainmail or not, check for spots in between plating where he can slide Da'Inkei,
		or if the plate is weak enough to be smashed with Mealfdrah (*see: Mealfdrah and Da'Inkei). (It isn't 100% infalible.
		The GM should roll a d20 without telling the players what it gave, and just tell the Kuff player information accordingly.
		Yes, Kuff may be wrong).
			- When rolling for sliding Inkei or Da'Inkei in between armour, a d20 is rolled, and the DM decides if it goes through
				or not. If it does, it ignores enemy armour (if the weapon is awakened or released it might have aditional effects.
				*See: Weapons->Da'Inkei). If it doesn't, it deals normal damage.
	
	- Worn Out Eyes: All of those years looking deep into the furnace didn't doo well for Kuff. He sees weel enough when its
		lit, but the man cant see very well in the dark. lower his perception (and probably his acuracy too) when in the dark.

	- In Tune With Magic: Being more in tune with magic than most orcs isn't that good for Kuff. Since he has more of an afinity
		with magic, but his mind isn't well trained to control it, he has an even harder time against magical manipulation attempts
		then most orcs. Is susceptable to mind control. (Disavantage 2 when resisting magical influence over his mind)

	- Swift feet... for an Orc: Kuff is clumsy, and he doesn't have that much battle experience. He doesn't fall a lot while on
		battle. Small for an orc, he is still quite big to most things, so it catches him off guard whenever somebody manages to
		take down the little guy. He takes a while to re-concentrate, get up and dust off. (If knocked down, takes 1 major action
		to get up).
		
- Weapons:
	- Explanation:
		- Name: The weapon's name
		- Lore and story: Self explanatory
		- States: an explanation of the weapon's effects when awakened and released.
			- Asleep: Any special characteristics the weapon has, even when asleep.
			- Awaken: The effects the weapon gains when awaken.
			- Released: Any aditional effects the weapon has when Released that it doesn't have when merely awaken. It still has
				all of the "Awaken" effects, but enhanced. 
		- Psycological effect: The effect the weapon has on Kuff's mind when awaken or released. the way it works mechanically is as
			follows: Whenever Kuff wants to make an action, before rolling the d20 for that action (if necessary), a d20 roll is made
			to se if he tries that action or one more in line with the weapon's personality and desire. the attribute used in this 
			roll is kuffs intelligence stat (Or Will attribute if using Open Legend). the chalenge rating is decided by the DM, taking
			into account how much the action goes against the weapon's personality, how strong the weapon's personality is (each weapon
			has higher or lower influence on kuff's mind. *see: Seals and Incantations->Personality), and how woke the weapon is(how high
			the roll for the activation of the weapon was).
		- Skills: The skills Kuff can use with the weapon while awake or released (some skills may only be used when released, or have
			different effects when released or awake). In order to use a skill, Kuff must call it's name in elvish (single-word. does
			NOT require a d20 roll to see if he remembers).
	- Tnakiesh:
		- Nome:
			o machado vampírico.
			Seu nome vem de tnaki, e o sufixo -esh. tradução literal "aquele(a) que leva a/transforma em/cria o sangue".

		- Lore and Story:
				A única arma de Kuff que usa blood-energy. ela é ativada por ssa, mas continua a se alimentar de tnaki se estiver
			disponível (não se alimenta do usuário, pois Tnakiesh reside na cabeça do machado, não na base). caso não consiga se
			alimentar de tnaki, Tnakiesh adormece, e precisa ser ativada de novo, cada vez com mais ssa, até que possa descansar. 
			Depois de acumular tnaki por várias batalhas nas mãos de Llat, o machado ficou pesado de mais para o seu cabo, e quebrou
			quando foi defletido pelo escudo de um paladino humano. A cabeça de Tnakiesh ricocheteou, e se fincou entre o pescoço e o
			ombro de Llat, atravessando sua clavícula e duas de suas costelas. uma vez lá ela absorveu todo o Tnaki de Llat, e parte
			de sua conciência, matando-o.

		- States: 
			- Asleep:
					tipical 2-handed double-headed war axe. Highest Damaging weapon against unarmored foes (highest base damage).
				Deals Slashing damage. Medium distance weapon, can cleave through a foe and hit any adjacent one if it kills the
				first. if the enemy is too close (like in dagger-striking range) it misses automatically, so Kuff must maintain
				the correct distance.

			- Awakened:
					Tnakiesh gains additional damage. If hasn't dealt damage to anything (*see: this->Skills->Feast) in 2 full turns
				while being awake, it goes back to sleep. Tnakiesh heals Kuff for a portion (recommended 1/5) of the damage dealt.

			- Released:
					Tnakiesh gains additional damage over the awakened form. If it hasn't dealt damage to anything in 3 full turns
				while being released it goes back to sleep. Tnakiesh heals Kuff for a portion (recommended 1/3) of the damage dealt.

		- Skills:
			- "Feast": Tnakiesh deals damage to Kuff equal to 20% of his maximum life (leaves him with 1 health if would send him
				to less than 1). Kuff gains a portion of that as extra damage on each attack for 5 turns, and his attacks heal him
				for half of the damager done (disregarding the awakened or released bonus.). (can be used awakened or released).

			- "Hunger": after Kuff hits an opponent with Tnakiesh, Kuff may activate Hunger, to do another attack in the same turn
				to the same enemy, dealing half damage. Deals full damage if Kuff ripped off a bodypart from the opponent with the
				attack used to trigger Hunger. If the attack ripped off an enemy bodypart, Kuff can repeat Hunger. Can be repeated
				up to 2 times. If Kuff sucessfully rips off an enemy bodypart with the third Hunger, Feast is imediatelly activated
				with no mana or hp cost (if the enemy died, another one close by may be used as target instead).

		- Psycological effect:
				While Tnakiesh is awaken or released kuff acts brashly, in a berserker-like rage. He cares less for retreating, self-
			-preservation and helping others, and lusts only for battle and blood.
	- Daih & Inkei & Da'Inkei: 
		- Nome:
			the names of the parts, coming from Kuffs native language of the weapon can be translated as:

			-Daih: 		(Da + ih) "Skyward Extension"
			-Inkei: 	(In + keih) "Lightning Spear"
			-Da'Inkei:	(Daih + Inkei) "Piercer of Heavens, Spear of Lightning"

		- Lore and Story:
			- Inkei is the name of the spear, Daih is the name of the extension rod atachable to the end of the handle, and
				Da'ikei is the name they assume when combined

		- States: 
			- Asleep:
					Long range melee weapon. Deals piercing damage. While asleep, Inkei might be used as a normal one or two handed
				spear, or extended with daih to make a two-handed spear. Has +1 advantage when used from max range, and +1 disadvantage
				when used from close range (close enough to be hit with a short one-handed sword). Has lowest base damage from all of
				Kuff's weapons.

			- Awakened:
					Inkei or Da'Inkei, but not Daih, can be awaken. When awoken, Inkei grants Kuff extra accuracy at all ranges(+1
				advantage), and a chance to release a little burst of electricity that deal extra damage, that may "Electrify" the enemy.
				Da'Inkei, when awoken, releases tiny burst of electricity on every sucessfull hit that deals extra lightning damage,
				and agaist enemies with plate armor has a chance to "Electrify" the enemy (rolled with a d20 against a chalen rating set
				by the DM). When rolling for sliding in between armor plates, Da'Inkei and Inkei gain +1 advantage. When it slides in
				between armor, gain +1 advantage when checking for "Electrifying" the enemy. If Kuff misses 2 Attacks one after the
				other, the spear goes to sleep.

			- Released:
					Only Da'Inkei may be released. The bursts of electricity are stronger (more added lightning damage). Enemies hit
				are automatically Electrified if hit from medium to long range (further then the range of a short one-handed sword or a
				long dagger), but wich Electrify effect happens is still decided by the DM (with a d20, if the DM so desires). If Kuff
				misses 2 attacks one after the other, Da'Inkei goes to sleep.

		- Skills: (only with Da'Inkei can Kuff use these skills)

			- "Pierce": Kuff lunges Da'Inkei foward, piecing the enemy (a strength check is made taking the enemy's size into consideration.
				if passed, Kuff raises the enemy with the spear). Deals A LOT more damage (probably double normal damage). Electrifies
				the enemy for certain. If released, roll a d20 against a chalenge rating set by the DM for a lightning to strike from
				the sky (if used outside. the burst of lightning deals double damage instead when used inside). If the enemy was raised
				by Kuff and Da'Inkei is released, the lightning strikes for sure.

			- "Kneel": Kuff launches Da'Inkei towards the enemy. it deals damage normally, but also rolls for pinning the enemy against
				the floor, wall, terrain or another foe stading behind the target. It automatically Electrifies the target if it hits.
				If used when released and hits, a lightning strikes down from the sky (if used outside. the burst of lightning deals
				double damage instead when used inside) and deals extra damage to it and nearby characters. IF the enemy is pinned, they
				cant move until they free themselves from the spear with a resist check. Da'Inkei's inherit advantage bonus and awakened
				advantage apply for hitting this skill(might be too OP, maybe should be removed).

			(OBS: i recommend for Pierce to be learned before Kneel, as pierce is basically just adding steroids to Da'Inkei's normal
			gameplay, while Kneel adds another very usefull tool for Kuff to use when in combat, and as such should probably be withheld
			for the future.)
			(OBS2: Kneel might seem a bit too OP, but an interesting balancing feature is that it leaves Kuff without a weapon until it
			is retrieved)

		- Comments:
			- "Electrify": zaps the opponent with lightning's electricity, hampering their ability to perform actions properly, or
				react to the world around them in 100% efficiency. Thus, depending on the rolls, the context, the weapon used (Inkei
				or Da'Inkei), the enemy, wether Kuff himself is "released" or not, etc. will determine if an "Electrified" enemy has
				one or more of the following effects:

				1. Recieves a negative bonus on their actions' rolls for a set time, and/or
				2. Grants a positive bonus for actions performed against them, and/or
				3. Become imobilized for a turn/set of turns.

	- Mealfdrah:
		- Nome:
			- taken from the dwarven language, it means literally "hard fire" or "hard flame". The name has a slight double
				meaning, as it references both the red color the hammer head assumes when it awakes and the fire or lava it
				makes when it hits the ground/enemies. it isn't particularly creative, but neither is Kuff.
		
		- Lore and Story:
		
		- States: 
			- Asleep:
					Short-Medium range War Hammer. Second highest base damage weapon. Has a chance to crack or break enemies'
				armor with every hit. If the enemies' armor is cracked, the chance of creaking it increases. cracking and
				breaking may also apply to shields and armor-like scales. Deals bludgeon damage

			- Awakened:
					Deals extra fire damage. If it cracks or breaks armor, deal extra fire damage to the enemy. if the enemy's
				armor is cracked, has higher chance of breaking it on hit.

			- Released:
					Deals extra fire damage. Half of the normal damage is converted into fire damage (won't matter in most
				situations, but it adds a nice flavour to the description of the attack). Has higher chance of breaking/
				cracking armor. Automatically breaks armor that is cracked on hit. Deals extra damage to foes with broken
				armor.

		- Skills:
			- "Melt" (only while released): Kuff strikes the ground (or nearby terrain), and creates a stream of molten 
				lava. this is usually not usefull, but in certain situations can be very helpfull, like when retreating,
				knocking down a collumn to make the ceiling collapse or removing the enemy's scape route.

			- "Burn" : Kuff strikes an enemy, and sets them ablase. deals extra damage fire damage, gives
				the enemy a burn for a few turns, and deals extra fire damage if their armor is cracked or broken. has 
				advantage +1 when checking for cracking/breaking armor. can be used when awakened or released.
			
			- "Incinerate" (only when released): Burn's released version. Hits an enemy and sets them ablase. Deals extra
				fire damage and gives them a burn effect for a few turns. Instantly breaks enemy armor if it hits. if the
				enemy already had broken armor, deal extra fire damage. (even when Mealfdrah is released, Burn may still be
				used instead of Incinerate if Kuff desires)

		- Comments:
			- "Cracked" armor: armor that has been cracked by Mealfdrah has reduced (2/3 of normal) damage mitigation.
			- "Broken" armor: armor that has been broken by Mealfdrah is rendered useless, and does not mitigate damage.
				(may be too OP. in that case, the armor has 1/3 of its normal damage mitigation).
	- Ki'id & Slawb & Ailat Ihneg:
		- Nome:
			the names of the weapons, coming from Kuffs native language of the weapon can be translated as:
				- Ki'id:	(ki + id) wind, more especifically wind strong enough to cut through skin.
				- Slawb:    (slawb) Wall.  (*Kuff isn't very creative, but he thinks the names fit well.
			- Ailat Ihneg comes from Kuffs native language. Ailat means brothers, and Ihneg is made from the radicals
				"ih"(sky/wind) and "-neg"(master of)Ailat Ihneg  can then be translated as "brother masters of the wind"

		- Lore and Story:
		- States: 
			- Asleep:
				Ki'id: Short-range slashing one-handed sword. Deals the second worst base damage, after Da'Inkei.
				Slawb: Tower shield. 'nuff said.
			- Awaken:
				Ki'id: Ki'id gains damage (the damage increase that Ki'id gains being awakened/released is considerably
					greater then the one other weapons gain, because of it's naturally worse base damage and the fact 
					that its utility is worse than Mealfdrah's, Tnakiesh's and Da'Inkei's). Kuff's movement speed increases
					by 1/3(doesn't take effect if Slawb is being used). The damage gain is halved if Slawb is being used.
					If Slawb isn't being used, Ignore "Swift feet... for an Orc" (*see: Perks & Flaws)
				Slawb: Kuff's movement speed is slowed to 1/2 of normal. increased defenses to any party member standing
					close to Kuff.
			- Released:
				Ki'id: Kuff gains 1/2 movement speed instead of the 1/3 of being awakened. Kuff gains +1 advantage on
					acrobatics saving trows and dodging enemy attacks. MORE damage.(now it becomes higher than Mealfdrah
					released,  but still worse than Tnakiesh released.)
				Slawb: Kuff can only move by spending his major action to move 1/2 of his normal speed. Any attacks coming
					directly from where slawb is pointed towards get blocked unless they roll a natural 20.
		- Skills:
			(with Ki'id, Slawb and Ailat Ihneg being 3 different set ups, if a skill can be used with Ki'id, it will be
			preceded with K; Slawb, S; and Ailat Ihneg, A)

			- (K/A) "Zephyr": After killing a foe with Ki'id, Kuff may make a dash, after dealing the blow, towards any
				direction. If he lands close to an enemy, Kuff may strike again (Zephyr may be recast with half of the
				cost if Kuff kills the new target). The total travel distance is reduced when holding Slawb. can be used
				when awakened or released

			- (S) "Tempest": Kuff focuses, and wind begins to whirl around Slawb, deflecting projectiles. All incoming
				projectiles roll against the a chalenge rating defined by a d20 roll by Kuff's player (+ a constant given
				by the Skill and/or Kuff's intelligence (or Energy, if using Open Legend)) to see if they hit or get
				deflected (being released increases this CR). if it gets reflected, the projectile rolls again to see if
				it comes back to the caster or if it goes into a random direction. The chalenge rating increases if Slawb
				is being used rather then Ailat Ihneg. Kuff can keep Tempest running by spending 1/3(rounded up) of the
				skills cost each turn. If Kuff looses focus, Tempest stops. Default duration is 1 turn. Counts as a major
				action to activate, but as a minor action to keep going

			- (K) "Gale": Kuff focuses, and wind begins to whirl around Ki'id, increasing it's damage. Kuff also has his
				movement speed increased by 1/2 during the duration. it can have it's duration extended by 2 turns by paying
				1/2 of the mana cost. Default duration of 3 turns. Counts as a minor action to Activate and maintain.

			- (S/A) "Gust": A Projectile wind attack is launched forth, in the direction Slawb is facing. The damage is
				higher if Ki'id isn't being used. The damage is also greatly increased if Tempest is active. The launched
				projectile stops at the first enemy it hits (unless hitting smaller foes, in wich case it may hit and go
				through them), deals damage and pushes them back.

- Seals and incantations:
	- Personality:
		- Explanation: each weapon Kuff has has a personality that affects his mind when the weapon is awake or released, and some are
			stronger and more influential then others. The closer to released a weapon is, the more in control of Kuff it is.
			
		- List:
			List from stronger to weaker in influence, and a sumary of it's personality:

				1. Tnakiesh: Brash, violent and blood-thirsty. easy to influence if bloodshed and a good battle is promissed.
				2. Da'Inkei: Pridefull, accurate and focused. Has disdain for everyone, get's really mad if insulted. Likes to
					finish off things it started.
				3. Slawb: Doesn't trust own strength, believes and follows allies without false, cares for others more than for itself
				2. Mealfdrah: Believes way too much in own strength. Goes for the biggest and strongest enemy. Doesn't care if hits
					allies with collateral damage. hard to intimidate
				3. Ki'id: Full of bravado, likes to mess around and play with the enemies. doesn't take things too seriously, and 
					tries to remove the weaklings first.
				5. Aliat Ihneg: Calm and in control. Is more careful than Kuff is normally. Tries to focus on priority targets.

	- Seals:
		
		- Explanation: When kuff was trained by Ehdud Dloc Mfle, to help him learn how to contain and release properly the
			ssa energy that built up on them, Ehdud engraved the weapons and Kuffs arms with a seal. The seal in the weapons
			contained and held back the energy that kuff gave the weapons, and locked their ability to recieve ssa from the
			environment, as that could cause acidents if Kuff didn't remember to constantly release their energy. The seal in
			the wepons had 3 "settings". normally the weapons would be asleep. When Kuff concentraded and recited the weapons name
			while holding it, the weapon whose name was called will "Awaken", changing the color of it's seal slightly, from the
			default black color to the weapon's color. the weapon would also grant kuff and itself special properties, and Kuff's
			personality will change. How much the weapon affects Kuffs mind varies from weapon to weapon. Each weapon has an 
			incantation in elvish asociated with it, given by Ehdud Dloc Mfle. If Kuff recites the whole incantation while
			concentrating on it, the weapon goes into it's third stage, as its "Released" from the seal. The seal that usually
			interrupts and slows down the weapons energy connection with Kuff, now amplifies it. Both the effects the weapon
			has on Kuff (positive and negative) and the energy cost to wield it (tnaki and ssa) increase. Kuff isn't that good
			with the elvish langauge, however, and sometimes forget some parts of the incantation. When that happens, the weapon
			goes into a state in between being simply awaken and released. Kuff is not smart enough to do that on pourpose though.
			He just forgets stuff sometimes.

			OBS: a d20 is then rolled before every attemp to recite an incantation, to see how much of it Kuff remembers,
				and how muchy concentration and energy he puts into it)

			There is also a final incantation, made for the seal on Kuff. That seal has 2 pourposes:

				1. To help Kuff control his ability to imbue his work with ssa. Because of the seal it now only happens if Kuff
					consciously desires to do so while smithing.

				2. Since Kuff warmed up to the idea of using his weapons in battle, Ehdud Dloc Mfle added the option for Kuff to
					release his seal temporarily. Just like Releasing with his weapons, Kuff's seal can work as a catalyzer,
					increasing the amount of energy Kuff releases through him. Since he starts to use more of his energy at the same
					time, both ssa and tnaki, he becomes strong enough to use one of his weapons in each hand (when used with Ki'id
					and Slawb, each weapon works as if it were being held alone). Not only that, but this mode also Releases any 
					weapon Kuff is holding. Each weapon now does only 50% of the damage it would deal if held with both hands, but
					Kuff can attack twice each turn, once with each weapon (it might be better to lower that damage to less than 50%,
					DM needs to be wary if Kuffs starts being too OP). If Holding Slawb, Kuff can only attack once per turn, but he
					has the defensive properties of Slawb active even while moving and attacking (this might also prove to be too
					powerful. If it is, simply reducing the numbers of Slawb's defenses when used in this state could fix it).

						OBS: the effects of the weapons on Kuffs mind are even stronger when he is in this mode, and they fight
							with each other too, so Kuff can get conflicting desires.

		- Seal Colors:
			As mentioned above, every seal on Kuff's weapons and on himself has a specific color associated with it. The default
		color on every seal (when it's on its normal state) is black, but when awakened or released, it glows on it's specific
		color. The colors on each seal are as follows:

			1. Tnakiesh:		Tanak (*See: language)
			2. Mealfdrah:		Orange
			3. Da'Inkei:		Yellow
			4. Ailat Ihneg:		Green
			5. Kuff's Seal:		White

	- Incantations:

			To help Kuff memorize them, Ehdud Dloc Mfle wanted to write them out for him, but since Kuff didn't
		know how to read or write in any language, he drew instead, using common objects that sounded, in the common
		language, like part of the verse in elvish. besides every verse, there is a subtitle in parenthesys. it goes
		like this:

				("part of the verse" = What Ehdud drew), or like this:
				("part of the verse" = What Ehdud drew->what it simbolises)
