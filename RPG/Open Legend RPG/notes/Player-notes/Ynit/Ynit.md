#  ynit namyob

## character concept:
Runic Mage, a Trickster-type character, focused on versatility. He inscribes little stones and instils magic on them.

Each rune represent a different spell, and he can only carry so many runes at a time. Each rune not only has different effects when used on an enemy, an ally or the terrain, but it also has variants of power, having lesser, normal and greater runes.

The gameplay of the character is focused on using the runes prepared beforehand, and using his skills to:

  - activate runes (costs very little mana)
  - upgrade runes (costs some mana)
  - create runes (costs a butt ton of mana)

## How Runes Work:

### Damage/Healing calculation:
when checking what dice to use for damage/healing, the attribute score used should be the relevant attribute (alteration) plus a value from the table below (plus the skill's bonus, if it has one), that depends on the rune lvl.

| rune level | value |
|------------|------:|
| 1          | -1	   |
| 2          | 0	   |
| 3          | +1	   |
| 4          | +2	   |
| 5          | +3	   |


## skills:
### Activate Rune:
Used to activate runes. The only way for a rune to be activated is through this skill. Upgrading this skill grants one of the following ways of activating runes:

  - Immediate
    - Activates instantly
    - 0 mana
  - Impact
    - activates when collided with something
    - 1 mana
    - default method, learned at lvl 1
  - Time
    - activates after a certain time
    - 2 mana
  - Serial
    - activates after a bonded rune activates
    - 3 mana
  - Pressure
    - activates on pressure (to set up like a mine)
    - 3 mana
  - Proximity
    - activates on proximity
    - 3 mana
  - External Influence
    - Ynit choses how much mana to spend in it, which is all stored into the rune, and used up each time it's used. when the rune runs out of mana, it becomes deactivated and null
    - VERY advanced
    - Releases it's runic spell partially when mana is infused onto it. Can release it's runic spell multiple times before running out of Ynit's mana. Everytime its infused with mana (equal to the level of the spell to be cast), it uses 4*the spell level of Ynit's stored mana

*Activating runes of level higher than three always requires a recital of their Poem. Optionally, all runes above a certain level (or just all runes in general) should only be able to be activated if the Poem is recited until an upgrade is acquired for the skill that increases that level, so that lower level runes can be activaded on the spot.

### Create Rune:
Uses Alteration. used to create runes on the spot. can create a known rune up to a certain level (depends on maximum known rune level and Creation stat).

The mana cost for creating runes can be checked on the table below. On the left is the level of the "Create Rune" skill, and on the right the Level of the Desired rune

Skill Level| Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5
-----------|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:
1          | 4       | -       | -       | -       | -      
2          | 3       | 5       | -       | -       | -      
3          | 2       | 4       | 6       | -       | -      
4          | 1       | 3       | 5       | -       | -      
5          | 1       | 3       | 4       | 7       | -      

#### Downtime Rune Creation
Most runes created by Ynit using Create Rune aren't made in the middle of battle, though. They're made during downtime. The table for Rune Creation cost. It takes 30 minutes per rune level, too.

Skill Level| Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5
-----------|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:
1          | 3       | 5       | -       | -       | -      
2          | 2       | 4       | 10      | -       | -      
3          | 2       | 3       | 8       | 20      | -      
4          | 1       | 2       | 6       | 14      | -      
5          | 1       | 2       | 4       | 9       | 24      
6          | 1       | 2       | 4       | 7       | 18      

### Energize Rune:
Uses Alteration/Learning. Ynit can focus for a turn, and spend mana and a major action to recite a rune's Poem, increasing the level of one rune temporarily by one. costs a significant ammount of mana. Possibilities of results given the roll include:

Standard results:
  - increasing the rune level by 1 just like normal.
  - increasing the rune level by 1 just like normal, but mana cost to activate is increased/decreased.
  - nothing happens.

Exeptional results:
  - decreasing rune level by one.
  - changing the type of rune into a known one (rare). (may have level increased, decreased or unchanged)
  - changing the type of rune into an unknown one (very rare). (may have level increased, decreased or unchanged)
  - "currupting" the rune. (unpredictably different effect. extremely rare)
  - if nat20, increase the rune by 2 levels (maybe lower a bit the result, DM choses).
    - only possible with high level of energize rune and high Alteration.
    - on even higher levels (like really high levels) of energize rune, decrease the CR to increase 2 levels
    instead of 1 from 20 (maybe decreasing it by Ynit's Alteration minus the original Rune level). the CR is
    higher the higher the original rune level is.

increases in skill level may grant:

- lower mana cost (higher cost reduction for lower level runes, not so much for higher level ones)
- make it so it takes a minor instead of a major action to energize a rune. (one upgrade for each level.
  level 3 energizing always costs a major action).
- lower the CR to energize a rune.
- unlock/increase the chance of increasing the rune level by 2.
