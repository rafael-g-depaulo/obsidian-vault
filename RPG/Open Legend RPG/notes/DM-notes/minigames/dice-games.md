* "Single Hand" Liar's Dice
  The game is played over multiple rounds. The first player for the first round is determined by mutual agreement or by
  all players rolling two dice with the highest roller becoming the first player. Play then proceeds clockwise around the
  table.

  To begin each round, all players roll their dice simultaneously. Each player looks at their own dice after they roll,
  keeping them hidden from the other players. (If any dice has landed on top of another, the player must roll all their
  dice again.)

  The first player then states a bid consisting of a face ("1's", "5's", etc.) and a quantity. The quantity represents the
  player's guess as to how many of each face have been rolled by all the players at the table, including themselves. For
  example, a player might bid "five 2's."

  Each subsequent player can either then make a higher bid of the same face (e.g., "six 2's"), or they can challenge the
  previous bid. (Note that there are a large variety of bidding variations that can be used. We'll describe some of them
  below.)

  If the player challenges the previous bid, all players reveal their dice. If the bid is matched or exceeded, the bidder
  wins. Otherwise the challenger wins.

  If the bidder loses, they remove one of their dice from the game by placing it in front of their dice cup.

  The loser of the previous round begins the next round.

  (In the event that the game comes down to two players with only a single dice each, bids are then made on the sum of both dice instead the quantity of faces rolled.)

  ** RULE VARIANT:Wild Ones
    - Ones are wild and count as the face of the current bid (unless "ones" are the currently-bid face value).

  ** Bidding Variants
    A player may bid a higher quantity of any face, or the same quantity of a higher face.
    A player may bid a higher quantity of the same face, or any quantity of a higher face.
    A player may bid a higher quantity of the same face or the same quantity of a higher face
