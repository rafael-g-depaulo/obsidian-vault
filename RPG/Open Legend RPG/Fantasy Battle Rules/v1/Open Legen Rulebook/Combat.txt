    $$$ DICE $$$$$$$$$:
        - (HR) There are 3 kind of dice rolls that determine how incertainty happens in the story. Initiative Rolls
            decide the order of action of characters in combat, and are decided with 1d20 + Agility. Attribute Rolls
            decide wether a skill/attack/bane/boon hits or not, resistance to banes, etc., and are decided with 1d20
            + 2 * Relevant Attribute. Damage Rolls decide Healing/Damage numbers, and are decided with the Attribute
            dice table, using the dice correspondant with the relevant Attribute for the attack/skill, and use exploding
            dice.
        - (HR) Any relevant action that impacts the story will be rolled with a d20
            - If there is a relevant atribute to the situation, it shall be dubbled, then added to the d20
            - If the resulting d20+2*atribute is equal to or higher then the chalenge rating (set by the DM), the
                action succeds.
            - Otherwise, the DM decides if the action failed and the story continues, or if it succeds with a twist.
            - The roll exceeding the chalenge rating by some arbitrary ammount may trigger additional effects, either
                decided by the DM or explicited by a character feat
            - If the d20 rolls a 20, the action will suceed automatically, and if it does damage or heals, the damage/heal
                is doubled. if it inflicts a bane, the foe will have +1 disadvantage when rolling for future resistance.
            - If the d20 rolls a 1, the action will fail automatically, independently of anything else.
                - Listen to the DM, he'll say what happens next.
        - (HR) Whenever a character is rolling for damage/healing and the character has 0 in the related atribute, it is
            rolled an exploding 1d2(a coin toss).
            - EX: this situation might occour if a mage-type character tries to perform a physical attack with a mace
                while having 0 Might, for example.
        - (CR modified) Whenever a roll is significantly higher than a specific chalenge rating, it is strongly recommended
            that the DM reward the action. Also recommended is that the DM insitute higher and higher rewards for breaking
            the chalenge rating more. examples of rewards are:
                - Add +1 or +2 advantage to damage/healing roll
                - Nullify or lessen the costs of performing the action (recoil damage, mana/stamina cost, etc.)
                - Just flat out double the damage, D&D style.
                - let the character perform another major action (recommended +1 or +2 disadvantage)
                - inflict a bane onto the target (if attacking)
                - inflict a boon onto the target or themselves(if supporting/defending/resisting)

    $$$ INITIATIVE $$$:
        - (HR) whenever combat starts, all characters involved in combat roll 1d20 + their respective Agility.
            The results then are ordered descendingly, and that becomes the order of actions each turn.

    $$$ DODGE $$$$$$$$:
        - (HR) if a character's Might is higher than 1.5 times their Agility (Rounded up), their dodge is 0
            - (HR) this aplies only to Dodge coming from stats. Dodge coming from equipment, feats or other
                means isn't nulified.
        - (HR) Whenever trying to hit an opponent aware of the attack, the chalenge rating to be overcome is
            increased by the defender's Dodge.
        - (HR) If an attack hits, even though the character had a Dodge level higher than 0, and the defender was
            aware of the attacker, the defender takes only a portion of the damage, inverselly proportional to the
            defender's Dodge.
        - (HR) Dodge is based on a character's Agility, Perception and size*(smaller is better).
            - Dodge also scales negativelly with Might (increasing might decreases dodge)
            - hint for character building: Agility > Perception for increasing dodge.
        - (HR) Dodge may also be increased by equipment, feats, boons, etc.
        - (HR) Dodge can go below 0, but the formula that reduces damage taken is ignored if so.
            - (If the formula wasn't ignored, the damage taken would be increased by a percentage proporcional
                to the absolute value of the now negative Dodge)

    $$$ ACTIONS $$$$$$:
        - During a characters turn in combat they may chose perform the actions listed below, in any wich order:
            - 1 Movement Action (move their character)
            - 1 Major Action (e.g.: all attacks, most skills, maintaining concentration skills(exceptions may occour), defending, etc.)
            - 1 Minor Action (e.g.: some skills are considered to be Minor Actions)
            - Any Number of Free Actions.

        - There are also Complete Actions. (e.g.: some more powerfull skills)
            - A character may chose to perform one Complete Action instead of their normal turn, and therefore forgo
                their Movement, Major and Minor actions.  
            - A character that cannot take a Major Action also can't perform a Complete Action.

    $$$ GUARD $$$$$$$$:
        - (HR) if a character's Agility is higher than 1.5 times their Might (Rounded up), their guard is 0
            - (HR) this aplies only to Guard coming from stats. Guard coming from equipment, feats or other
                means isn't nulified.
        - (HR) Whenever a character is hit, the damage is (AFTER dodge), reduced by their guard stat.
        - (HR) Guard is based on the character's Might, Fortitude, Protection and size*(bigger is better).
            - hint for character building: Might > Fortitude > Protection for increasing Guard.
        - (HR) Guard may also be increased by equipment, feats, boons, etc.
        - (HR) (optional) Since the size bonus can be negative, guard may be negative, increasing damage taken
            by a flat ammount.

        *Size is decided by the DM when a character is created, and goes from 1 to 10;

    $$$ DEFENDING $$$$:
        - (HR) A character may spend their major action to prepare a defense, that lasts until their next turn.
            the character rolls a defense score, wich is equal to: 1d20 + Dodge + Defense Attribute Score for that
            situation (DM's choice wich attribute applies to wich situation)

        - (HR) Any attacks made against the character are then checked against their defense score, and the
            apropriate effect is applied:

            ATK Roll >  DEF Roll:   the attack follows as usual
            ATK Roll <= DEF Roll:   the attack follows, but deals half damage and the defender has +1Advantage
                                        on any resistance against any Banes the attack might inflict
            ATK Roll <= DEF Roll-5: the attack deals no damage, and inflicts no bane
    
    $$$ ATTACKING $$$$:
        - (HR) When a character attacks, they make an attack roll, and compare that with a CR to hit that the
            deffender has. if the attack is equal to or greater than the CR, the attack goes through.

        - (HR) the CR to hit is calculated as such:
                8 + characters' Dodge

        - (HR) the attack roll is calculated as such:
                1d20 + ATK
            ATK: Attaking Attribute

    $$$ MAGICAL PERCEPTION $$$$:
        - (HR) differently than all other attribute rolls(wich are rolled with 1d20+2*attribute), rolling to percieve
            magical influences may, at the DM's discretion, be rolled as:

            (1d10 OR 1d12 OR 1d8 OR 1d6, recommend the ones on the left) + Perception*2 + Prescience*2
