    $$$ Banes $$$$$$$$:
        - (CR) Banes are status effects that can be inflicted onto a character, usually throung the use of a skill.
            - In order to inflict a bane a character must meet the Bane's Attribute and/or Feat requirements.
            - Trying to defend againts a bane is done through meeting the chalenge rating set by the DM for that
                circumstance.
        - (HR) If a defence roll is a critical failure, or the attack roll is a natural 20, the DM may chose to then
                apply a higher level version of the same bane, if available.
        - (HR) If a roll to inflict a bane fails by a little, the DM may chose that a lower level version of the
                bane is inflicted instead, if available.
        - (CR) A bane has a default duration. After every turn since it's inflicted with a bane, a character rolls
                against a chalenge rating set by the DM (usually the same as the CR to defend against it initially)
                to try to resist it. If a character keeps failing, the bane will expire at it's natural duration.

    $$$ Boon $$$$$$$$:
        - (CR) Boons are buffs that affect a character, and can be self aplied of given by a friendly skill or item
            property.
            - Most boons will be aplied through skills, and are automatically if the skill hits, or if the roll
                surpassed the chalenge rating by some arbitrary ammount.
        - (CR modified) Boons may either:
            - Have a set duration
            - Have a maximum duration, with the character(s) affected by the boon rolling to maintaing it every turn
                against a Chalenge rating set by the DM. If it fails, the boon stops taking effect.
        - (CR) Some boons can have their default duration extended if the character affected by it wishes to do so,
            and surpass the Chalenge rating set by the DM, in a standard d20 roll plus two times the relevant attribute.
        - (HR) If the roll to apply a boon lands a natural 20, or exceeds the Chalenge Rating by an arbitrary ammount,
            a higher version of the Boon may be aplied, if available (and allowed by the DM)
        - (HR) If the roll to apply a boon is slightly below the Chalenge Rating set by the DM, a lower level version
            of the boon may be applied, if available (and allowed by the DM)

#### COMBAT 'N SHIT #################################################################################################

    $$$ DICE $$$$$$$$$:
        - (HR) There are 3 kind of dice rolls that determine how incertainty happens in the story. Initiative Rolls
            decide the order of action of characters in combat, and are decided with 1d20 + Agility. Attribute Rolls
            decide wether a skill/attack/bane/boon hits or not, resistance to banes, etc., and are decided with 1d20
            + 2 * Relevant Attribute. Damage Rolls decide Healing/Damage numbers, and are decided with the Attribute
            dice table, using the dice correspondant with the relevant Attribute for the attack/skill, and use exploding
            dice.
        - (HR) Any relevant action that impacts the story will be rolled with a d20
            - If there is a relevant atribute to the situation, it shall be dubbled, then added to the d20
            - If the resulting d20+2*atribute is equal to or higher then the chalenge rating (set by the DM), the
                action succeds.
            - Otherwise, the DM decides if the action failed and the story continues, or if it succeds with a twist.
            - The roll exceeding the chalenge rating by some arbitrary ammount may trigger additional effects, either
                decided by the DM or explicited by a character feat
            - If the d20 rolls a 20, the action will suceed automatically, and if it does damage or heals, the damage/heal
                is doubled. if it inflicts a bane, the foe will have +1 disadvantage when rolling for future resistance.
            - If the d20 rolls a 1, the action will fail automatically, independently of anything else.
                - Listen to the DM, he'll say what happens next.
        - (HR) Whenever a character is rolling for damage/healing and the character has 0 in the related atribute, it is
            rolled an exploding 1d2(a coin toss).
            - EX: this situation might occour if a mage-type character tries to perform a physical attack with a mace
                while having 0 Might, for example.
        - (CR modified) Whenever a roll is significantly higher than a specific chalenge rating, it is strongly recommended
            that the DM reward the action. Also recommended is that the DM insitute higher and higher rewards for breaking
            the chalenge rating more. examples of rewards are:
                - Add +1 or +2 advantage to damage/healing roll
                - Nullify or lessen the costs of performing the action (recoil damage, mana/stamina cost, etc.)
                - Just flat out double the damage, D&D style.
                - let the character perform another major action (recommended +1 or +2 disadvantage)
                - inflict a bane onto the target (if attacking)
                - inflict a boon onto the target or themselves(if supporting/defending/resisting)

    $$$ INITIATIVE $$$:
        - (HR) whenever combat starts, all characters involved in combat roll 1d20 + their respective Agility.
            The results then are ordered descendingly, and that becomes the order of actions each turn.

    $$$ DODGE $$$$$$$$:
        - (HR) if a character's Might is higher than 1.5 times their Agility (Rounded up), their dodge is 0
            - (HR) this aplies only to Dodge coming from stats. Dodge coming from equipment, feats or other
                means isn't nulified.
        - (HR) Whenever trying to hit an opponent aware of the attack, the chalenge rating to be overcome is
            increased by the defender's Dodge.
        - (HR) If an attack hits, even though the character had a Dodge level higher than 0, and the defender was
            aware of the attacker, the defender takes only a portion of the damage, inverselly proportional to the
            defender's Dodge.
        - (HR) Dodge is based on a character's Agility, Perception and size*(smaller is better).
            - Dodge also scales negativelly with Might (increasing might decreases dodge)
            - hint for character building: Agility > Perception for increasing dodge.
        - (HR) Dodge may also be increased by equipment, feats, boons, etc.
        - (HR) Dodge can go below 0, but the formula that reduces damage taken is ignored if so.
            - (If the formula wasn't ignored, the damage taken would be increased by a percentage proporcional
                to the absolute value of the now negative Dodge)

    $$$ ACTIONS $$$$$$:
        - During a characters turn in combat they may chose perform the actions listed below, in any wich order:
            - 1 Movement Action (move their character)

            - Any number of Minor Actions (e.g.: some skills are considered to be Minor Actions)

        - There are also Complete Actions. (e.g.: some more powerfull skills)
            - A character may chose to perform one Complete Action instead of their normal turn, and therefore forgo
                their Movement, Major and Minor actions.  
            - A character that cannot take a Major Action also can't perform a Complete Action.

    $$$ GUARD $$$$$$$$:
        - (HR) if a character's Agility is higher than 1.5 times their Might (Rounded up), their guard is 0
            - (HR) this aplies only to Guard coming from stats. Guard coming from equipment, feats or other
                means isn't nulified.
        - (HR) Whenever a character is hit, the damage is (AFTER dodge), reduced by their guard stat.
        - (HR) Guard is based on the character's Might, Fortitude, Protection and size*(bigger is better).
            - hint for character building: Might > Fortitude > Protection for increasing Guard.
        - (HR) Guard may also be increased by equipment, feats, boons, etc.
        - (HR) (optional) Since the size bonus can be negative, guard may be negative, increasing damage taken
            by a flat ammount.

        *Size is decided by the DM when a character is created, and goes from 1 to 10;

    $$$ DEFENDING $$$$:
        - (HR) A character may spend their major action to prepare a defense, that lasts until their next turn.
            the character rolls a defense score, wich is equal to: 1d20 + Dodge + Defense Attribute Score for that
            situation (DM's choice wich attribute applies to wich situation)

        - (HR) Any attacks made against the character are then checked against their defense score, and the
            apropriate effect is applied:

            ATK Roll >  DEF Roll:   the attack follows as usual
            ATK Roll <= DEF Roll:   the attack follows, but deals half damage and the defender has +1Advantage
                                        on any resistance against any Banes the attack might inflict
            ATK Roll <= DEF Roll-5: the attack deals no damage, and inflicts no bane

        - (HR) Exceptional physical feats (attacking, some types of movement, blocking attacks) and some skills drain
            the user's stamina
        - (HR) When a character has insuficient stamina to perform an action it still rolls, but has +1 disadvantage
            if the character has positive stamina values, +2 disadvantage if has stamina between 0 and -25% of their
            maximum stamina, and fails automatically if they have less then -25% of their maximum stamina.
        - (HR) Performing actions that exert stamina when at 0 or below stamina may have consequences besides the
            disadvantage (the DM will roll a secret d20 to see wich one). those may include:
                - increase the character's maximum stamina
                - lower the damage or healing the character would have done with the action

            player characters apply)
        - (HR) Whenever a player character reaches 0 hp the DM will roll 1d20 and not tell the players the result.
            - The roll will be measured against a chalenge rating set by the DM for that specific instance of the
