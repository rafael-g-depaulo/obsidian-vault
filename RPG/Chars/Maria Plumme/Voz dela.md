ok this is better, but i think i might be able to find something better. also remember to test using normal volume to see if the voice can handle it.

ok this is it. i was holding my fingers right above my collar bone and on my chest. my chest was still, but my high throat was vibrating.

ok this is great. it's not as good as the third one, but it's way easier to be consistent. with this i kept one finger below my adams apple to try to remember to keep it high

contrast test to see how different it is from my normal speaking voice

ok, like the contrast. it's definitely decent. lest try one more time to make sure i can do it consistently. also i'll try to do it a bit louder.
