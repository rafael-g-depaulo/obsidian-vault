# Lyf

## Description
Lyf (it/its) is the god of putritude, maggots, vermin, rot, entropy and decay. It's sometimes called by other names, including:

  - Duke of Flies
  - Lord of the Unburied
  - Eater of All

## History
People say that some gods are more "human" than others. Some gods are understandable. They have alliances, desires, enemies, etc. In short, they have comprehensible will and agency. Other gods arent like that. They dont think, dont change, dont want, dont take. They are. More "Forces of Nature" than living entities, you might say. Lyf is one of those.

It doesnt have a church. It doesnt have devote followers, favorite things or plans for the future. Lyf consumes, and nothing else.

Life may seem diverse and full of choices and chaos (and from some points of view it may be that), but to Lyf its always the same. Things live, things die, and It eats them. All that is or was alive, all organic matter, all magic, everything in existence, will eventually be consumed by It, and die (the order of these 2 things can vary. Living things can rot, whether they want to or not).

And from the ashes left behind by Lyf, life may use those remains to build itself again. Like a tree's roots using the decomposed nutrients of old leaves to grow, from the its previous remains life may rise once more, so it may one day be consumed again, and rot.

## Appearence
