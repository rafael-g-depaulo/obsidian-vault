Triva:

- Lyf is the deity of decomposing bodies, and as such takes care of breaking down bones.
  What is left after a skeleton is decomposed is just white phosphorus, which is often
  used to summon Boitatás, as that's how one is born. Because of that, although they are
  not used as symbols of lyf, the Boitatás are usually respectfull and thankfull for him
  and his followers, sometimes even befriending them.
