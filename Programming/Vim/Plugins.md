hA lot of these are taken from [this article](https://dev.to/craftzdog/my-neovim-setup-for-react-typescript-tailwind-css-etc-58fb), and [this one](https://alpha2phi.medium.com/neovim-plugins-and-configuration-recipes-3d508798eab7) seems to have some nice ones too

## Necessary
- b0o/mapx.nvim

## Completion
- [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) (looks cool and maybe really useful)
- [cmp-nvim-lsp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp) (meh)
- [cmp-buffer](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-buffer) (meh)
- [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) (some config for nvim's default LSP. maybe it's useful, but idk since i'm already using treesitter)
- [lsp_signature](https://github.com/ray-x/lsp_signature.nvim) lets me open a vscode-like helper window for the types and junk
- alvan/vim-closetag
- kylechui/nvim-surround

## Features
- tpope/vim-commentary

## LSP
- glepnir/lspsaga.nvim
	- nvim-web-devicons
- nvim-treesitter

## Learning
- hardtime.nvim
