## Intro
[pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) is aÂ daemon process manager that will help you manage and keep your application online.

Basically, it helps run your processes, has some cool info and stuff, restarts on error and stuff like that.

## Install
```sh
npm i -g pm2 # i recommend a global install, thus npm
```

## Usage
To make a package.json script run forever you can do it like
```sh
pm2 start yarn --name app-name -- start
```

**OBS:** for some reason the first time i tried it yarn errored out and only npm worked. if you find an issue with the app crashing almost immediately, maybe this'll help you

## Run pm2 and it's apps on startup
If you want pm2 to always run even if the machine restarts (you do), run `pm2 startup` and it'll give you a command. Run that command and you're gucci.

Just remember to run `pm2 save` to save your currently running apps as the ones to run at startup.
