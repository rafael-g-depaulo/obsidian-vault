Using mainly [this article](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/get-game-controllers-running-linux/), i configured and calibrated my controller to work on ubuntu with the package `jstest-gtk` (though `joystick` and `xboxdrv` might have been useful as well)

after installing it with `apt`, just running `jstest-gtk` was enough.
