## Why
I deal with the `/etc/sudoers` file and the `/etc/sudoers.d/`  directory mostly to add commands that a user should be able to use without sudo (without password)

## Sources
[this article](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-running-sudo-command-without-a-password/) shows the basics of how to get into the sudoers file (**REMEMBER TO ONLY EDIT THAT FILE WITH `visudo`, NOT OTHER EDITORS**)
