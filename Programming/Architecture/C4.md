## Oficial Docs
The [official site](https://c4model.com/) of C4 has a lot of useful resources.

## Tools
There are a lot of tools that allow you to create C4 models, but i'm currently using mostly [Gaphor](https://gaphor.org/)

## How To
To create a C4 diagram using Graphor, you just create according to the pre-made model, and continue as such:

### Context (Systems & People)
create a system contex (canvas), add a primary element, and connect it with people and connecting software systems. It's for everyone.
- **Scope:** A single software system
- **Primary Element:** The software system
- **Supporting Elements:** People and software systems
- **Intended Audience:** Stakeholders and team members in training

### Container (Apps that make the system)
- **Scope:** A single software system
- **Primary Elements:** Containers (services) within scope
- **Supporting Elements:** People and software systems
- **Intended Audience:** Dev and Ops.

### Component (Services that make the App)
- **Scope:** A single container (app)
- **Primary Element:** Components making the app
- **Supporting Elements:** Containers connecting to the current container
- **Intended Audience:** Dev and Ops. Optional.

### Code
Don't bother.
