## Specialist
Specialists are exactly what the name implies, incredibly specialized combatants that, instead of focusing on complete mastery of the arcane, martial combat or even a balance of both, have a single niche proficiency or knowledge they use to dominate the battlefield in their own way. Rogues, Artificers, Gunslingers, Alchemists, all of these are primary examples of how a Specialist Class works.

### Hit Points (HP) & Mana Points (MP)
A Specialist's maximum HP and MP are calculated as such:
- **HP at 1st Level:** 10 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP at 1st Level:** 5
- **HP gain per level after 1st:** 3 + their Constitution modifier
- **MP gain per level after 1st:** 5

### Attribute Score Increase
- Specialist **Gains ASI at levels:** 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19. (8 Total)

### Feats
A specialist has access to all Specialist Feats.

### Expertise
Starting at 2nd level, a Specialist gains the **Expertise** feature.

**Expertise.** Choose a number of skills equal to you inteligence modifier (min 1). Before performing a non-attack roll with one of those skills, you may spend 1PM to add your inteligence modifier to the roll. At levels 6, 10, 14 and 18 you chose another skill, and can spend +1PM, and the total added to the roll equals the MP cost times your inteligence modifier.

### Attacks
- **Simple Weapon Proficiency**: Any Specialist character has proficiency with Simple Weapons

### Spells
None by default
