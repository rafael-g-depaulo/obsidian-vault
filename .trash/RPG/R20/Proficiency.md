# Proficiency
Proficiency is used mainly for 3 things:
	- determining the DC for a skill's effect (i.e.: the DC to resist a character's magic)
	- making attack rolls
	- making saving throws with an attribute a character is proficient in

A character's proficiency is directly determined by their overall level, following the formula below.

- **Proficiency: char's level / 2 (rounded up) **

Here's a table with the proficiency levels for all levels from 1 to 20.

D&D's formula: ceiling(lv / 4) + 1
  - lv1-4 -> 2, lv5-8 -> 3, lv9-12 -> 4, etc.
 
T20's formula: floor(lv/2) + (2/4/7 depending on level)
  - lv1: 0, lv2-3 -> 1, lv4-5 -> 2, lv6-7 -> 3, lv8-9 -> 4, etc.

R20's formula: ceil(lv/2)
