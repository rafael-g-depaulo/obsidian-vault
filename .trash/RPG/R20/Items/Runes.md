## Runes
You can enchant an item with runes to add a special effect to it. You create runes by rolling Arcana. Each rune has a number of uses, and after that it must be recharged with MP during a rest.

<!-- have runes that allow you to cast spells as actions, and some as reactions to being hit or when crit -->
