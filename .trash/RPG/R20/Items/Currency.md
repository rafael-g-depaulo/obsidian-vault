# Coins
All items and services referred to in this book are measured in copper, silver, gold and platinum coins. These are the currencies the system expects you to use, though your table may adapt this to something more suitable for your setting.

In it's original intention, copper and silver are the coins of the populous. when you buy groceries, pay tolls, or get a new set of tools for your job, you use silvers and get some coppers for change. gold is used for rent, buying a horse, a weapon or other substantial expenses, which are usually worth multiple days' worth of an average person's wage. Platinum is then the coin of the rich, of institutions and of governments. It's the choice for those who only don't use gold because they're dealing with sums of money so astronomical that the weight of the gold itself would be a hassle.

The conversion between the currencies follows the ratio:
- 50 copper = 10 silver = 1 gold = 1/5 platinum

These units are usually shortened using the following symbols:

| platinum | p                 |
