# Drink Competition

### team-style elimination:
2 teams of n people gather (recomend a number between 3 and 1 less than the ammount of players) the teams have an entering order.

Each person starts with 3 "endurance points" and a drunkness CR (that starts at 12). everytime a person takes a drink, they roll a fortitude attribute check against their drunkness CR. if they meet it, the CR increases by 2. if they fail it, they lose a endurance point. on a nat20, gain 1 endurance point, on a nat1, lose 2. once a player reaches 0 endurance points, they're out (barf, pass out, etc.)

(consider increasing or decreasing the starting CR depending on a character's background, or giving them more endurance points)

the first competititor from each team enters. both competitors take a drink. once a competitor is out, their next teammate goes in. once a team's last member goes out, they lose.

teams can bet on the outcome of the game (and on how many competititors are left on the winning team). if a team has won a competition for X gold, they may recieve (and accept or refuse) a challenge from a new team (of any size). if they accept the bet of Y gold from the challengers and win, the challengers pay the winning team X+Y gold. if the challengers win, the old champions have to pay the new champions Y gold.
