serverless view count working. now i'm working on strapi. first making it work locally before trying to deploy. i'm following a [guide](https://blog.vikfand.com/posts/serverless-strapi-tutorial/) trying to deploy it in a serverless function, but may need to settle for EC2. the challenge right now is to run it locally (yarn v3 x v1 seems to be the source. some issue with the "sharp" package on yarn install);

there's also a guide for [strapi v4](https://blog.vikfand.com/posts/serverless-strapi-tutorial/) if needed. maybe i could just upgrade to v4 since v3 is giving me such a headache.
