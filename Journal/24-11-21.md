## Motivation/Base idea
looking into integrating reactjs into foundry. it looks like the only issue is with the `RegisterSheet` method in the `Actors` and `Items` classes, and the `BlankSheet` class given to it as argument.

So if i give a class to registerSheet that implements the correct method API, it should work. the default ActorSheet extends the ([DocumentSheet](https://foundryvtt.com/api/classes/client.DocumentSheet.html) => [FormApplication](https://foundryvtt.com/api/classes/client.FormApplication.html) => [Application](https://foundryvtt.com/api/classes/client.Application.html)) class chain. creating an extention of any of them (probably DocumentSheet just to keep the most base features) and just overriding the methods used for rendering to use ReactDOM instead of handlebars should work. Then i just gotta use that new `ReactSheet` as a base class when creating new sheets and GG. (maybe making a "HOF" that takes a class and returns a derived class that overrides the render functionality would be cool, as it gives the flexibility to use other Application subclasses, not just the DocumentSheet chosen arbitrarily earlier).

Going by the [Application documentation page](https://foundryvtt.com/api/classes/client.Application.html), the following things should be overwritten:
- template getter?? idk but maybe? seems like strictly handlebars stuff that should be removed but maybe just leaving it as is is better than trying to remove it and messing with something unrelated that relies on it. ![[Pasted image 20241121225846.png]]

- \_render (decent chance that if this is changed then `render` can be left as is)![[Pasted image 20241121230153.png]]
- \_renderOuter![[Pasted image 20241121230245.png]]
- \_renderInner![[Pasted image 20241121230328.png]]
- \_replaceHTML![[Pasted image 20241121230347.png]]
- \_injectHTML![[Pasted image 20241121230408.png]]

And these probably shouldn't need to be changed but idk
