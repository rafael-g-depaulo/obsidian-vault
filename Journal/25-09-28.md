- [ ] procurar neg√≥cio do banco pra mandar pra elaine


I tried to convey the following previously via chat but the connection was cut off before I could finish typing:

Situation: This AWS account is owned by a small academic research group from Brazil, with a tight budget. It has seen constant use with dutiful payment for years. In a recent infrastructure change, a contracted Dev added a RDS instance to host a small Postgres database containing content used in the group's website. Unbeknownst to us, some setting or additional sub-service seems to be turned and left on. As a result of this, the invoice for the following 2 months (before the situation was noticed and the RDS instance terminated) grew astronomically. The invoice that typically was either cents or in the single digit dollars suddenly ballooned to over a thousand dollars.

Request: I am aware that AWS sometimes forgives such accidental expenses for students/beginners/small businesses. This account is owned by a non-profit small group, and currently managed by a single junior freelancer. Considering the situation and this context, I asked previously if it was possible to forgive those 2 invoices.

Reason for message: After the request I was told by support that someone would come in contact with the result after this case was reviewed. I was then advised to follow up to check in and possibly speed up the process. Thus, the previous chat attempt and this message.
