### AWS
Hello.

I see that then the account suspension can't be lifted (even temporarily) until the bills are paid. I have informed this to SDMRG.

I must insist, still, that this amount is extremely outside of SDMRG's budget. Even if the review can't be formally completed in the current state, is it possible to have a preliminar idea of if the review is likely to be successful or not? Because since the ultimate goal is to have this charge removed/cancelled/reimbursed, I believe that SDMRG would pay if they were confident about the result. I fully understand that what i am asking is an informal estimate with no binding, but such reassurance and confidence about the likely result of the review would be helpful to motivate them to act.

Regards,
Rafael.
