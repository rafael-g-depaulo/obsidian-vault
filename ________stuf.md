Hi, Jaime. Can i just validate something with you, real quick?

A really bad heat wave has hit where i live in the last few days. It's bad enough that nearly everyday I get some pretty bad headaches, and even have to take some time in the middle of the day (during the hotter hours) and stop working, just lay down a bit. I'm still always online during my working hours, and by shifting a lot of the work i do to the night time i've been able to keep up with my daily 8 hour shifts.

I wanted to make sure that this is ok (me doing some of my responsibilities later on in the day for technical reasons, while still being reachable and available during regular working hours if I'm needed), and also wonder
